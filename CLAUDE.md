Guidance for working in this repository.

## What this project is

A personal toolkit for producing **choir practice tracks** from MuseScore 3
sheet music. It has two halves:

1. **MuseScore QML plugins** (`plugins/`) that run *inside* MuseScore 3 to edit
   scores and export audio.
2. **Python scripts/packages** (`src/`, plus thin CLI wrappers in the repo root)
   that process MuseScore files (`.mscx`/`.mscz`/MusicXML) as XML, fix lyrics,
   and automate audio/video recording + YouTube upload.

The end goal: take a SATB-style score where multiple voices share a staff, split
it so each voice has its own staff, generate per-voice practice audio (each voice
louder than the rest), record a play-along video, and optionally upload to
YouTube.

MuseScore `.mscx` files are XML; almost all musical processing is `lxml` tree
manipulation. There is no database: persistent app state is JSON/files under
`songs/`. The local FastAPI server and vanilla-JS frontend in `src/song_app/`
orchestrate the same file-based tools.

## Environment & running

- Python 3.13, virtualenv at `.venv/`. Use `.venv/bin/python` directly.
- Install deps: `.venv/bin/pip install -r pip-requirements.txt`
  (lxml, pytest, dotenv, google-api-python-client, google-auth-oauthlib, pillow,
  pyautogui, fastapi, uvicorn, python-multipart; recording also needs
  `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` on PATH, and macOS with MuseScore 3 + QuickRecorder).
- Config is via `.env` (falls back to `.env.default`). Keys:
  `MUSESCORE_CLI_PATH`, `MUSESCORE_EXPORT_PATH`, `VIDEO_EXPORT_PATH`,
  `YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRETS_PATH`, and optionally `STEMMANAUHAT_DISPATCH_TOKEN` /
  `STEMMANAUHAT_REPO` (site refresh after upload), and `MEDIA_ROOT` (#370,
  `src/media_root.py`): where song media goes — `$MEDIA_ROOT/<slug>/` instead of
  `songs/<slug>/media/`, about 150 MB per voice video at 4K. Code asks
  `Song.media_path(...)` / `media_root.media_dir(song_dir)`, never
  `songs/<slug>/media` directly. A song not moved yet is read where it is, and
  `scripts/move_media.py` moves it (copy, SHA-256 check, one rename, then delete;
  skips a song whose `.recording.lock` is live). The root `conftest.py` blanks it so
  tests never write to the real media disk. On this host it is
  `/var/mnt/ssd/choir-media`. Never commit real secrets;
  `.env`, `client_secrets.json`, and `token.pickle` are gitignored.
- The CLI wrappers import the package via `from src.clean_score... import ...`,
  so **run them from the repo root** (e.g. `./clean_score.py ...`). Their shebang is the
  system `python3`, which lacks the dependencies, so unless `.venv` is activated run them
  as `.venv/bin/python clean_score.py ...`.
- `./song.py` prefers port 8000, scans the next 49 ports when it is occupied,
  and enables uvicorn source reload by default (watching only `src/`). Use
  `--port`, `--no-browser`, or `--no-reload` when needed.

### The prototyping fixture

`fixtures/virta-venhetta-vie/` is a real public-domain song (Kuula/Leino, TTBB,
scanned + OCR'd) kept at three stages, so a change can meet real OCR damage
immediately instead of a synthetic score. **Not** a unit-test fixture in the usual
sense — though `test_pdf_systems.py`, `test_bounds_api.py` and the browser tests do
read it — and it is free to change shape as the app does.

`10-cleaned/fixes.json` carries score edits a person authorised — things the
automatic passes refuse to guess at (`utils/score_fixes.py`). Each entry names a
staff, measure and chord, and says **why**. Applying is strict: an entry that no
longer matches raises, so a pipeline change that moves the note fails the build
instead of quietly leaving the defect in. Fix a song's defect from the printed page into
that song's `fixes.json`, with the reason; do not add a deterministic repair pass for it.

**Every song gets this, not just the fixture.** `run_clean` applies
`<song dir>/fixes.json` right after cleaning (`pipeline.apply_recorded_fixes`), so a
recorded edit survives a re-clean. Before that it did not: cleaning rebuilds from the
source, so a hand edit made afterwards vanished the next time anyone cleaned, and the
same three page-verified rests were typed into Kaksi laulua krapulasta twice in one
session. Replaying a recorded fix is not the pipeline guessing — the judgement was
already made and written down. A fix that no longer matches fails the clean with the
entry named, rather than being skipped.

Three kinds: `undot` and `slur` name a chord, and `append` works on the end of a bar
(`drop` takes off the rest a scan padded with in place of notes it lost). Appending
rather than rewriting keeps what the tokens cannot carry — a triplet bracket, a tie —
and every kind checks what the bar reads **now** (`from`) before touching it, tuplet
brackets included. A note's spelling is derived from its pitch: the first fixes to
carry one by hand got three of four wrong.

Three more were added for fixing a song from its page with an LLM (#340), because an
agent on Annin laulu had to fake each of them and the fakes damaged the score.
`unslur` (staff, measure, `index` of the chord the slur starts on) takes out a slur the
scan invented or pinned on the wrong voice, both halves, wherever the end half sits;
before it, the only way was to rewrite the bar twice with `bar`, which moved fermatas
and left a slur half stored on a chord in another bar (`rejected_bars._cut_spanners`
now cuts those too). `tie` (`index`, `pitch`) joins that note to the same pitch in the
next chord, in this bar or the next, so playback holds it — a slur in its place lands
the words right and still sings the note twice. `duration` (`index`, `to`, a length
like `quarter..`) gives one chord another length, double dots included, and when that
makes the voice fill the time signature the bar gets that length back **on every
staff** (its `len` goes and a whole-bar rest is lengthened with it); any other total
refuses. When it does, the **back-steps** cleaning used to squeeze the other voices into
the short bar (a negative `<location>`) go too, wherever that voice's own notes fill the
restored bar exactly (#344): otherwise MuseScore's check, which runs after the fixes,
reads those voices as too long and resets them to rests nothing recorded could undo —
Gute Nacht bar 6 and Annin laulu bars 9, 10 and 21. And a `bar` fix no longer refuses
a voice with a gap in it: it takes the gap out and writes the bar afresh, which then has
to fill the bar's own length (Integer vitae T2 bar 9, Jouluyö's last bar). It may
also fill the bar's own length when the scan made the voice longer than the bar (#350):
false triplets left Lasinkuultava laulu's T1 bar 9 7/6 long in 4/4, which no writable
lengths add up to. All three take a `from` and refuse without one. `GET /bar` now also returns
the bar's `from` (rests included), and the lyric import's reply carries `mismatches`.

`GET /bar` answers the questions agents writing fixes kept getting wrong (#357). Each
chord carries `at`, its place in `from`, and `items` pairs every `from` token with the
chord `index` it has (`null` for a rest or bracket), since `index` counts chords only;
a wrong `index` is refused with the chords listed. Each note in `pitches` gives its MIDI
`pitch` and whether a tie leaves it (`tied_to_next`) or reaches it (`tied_from_prev`).
A bar MuseScore's check reset carries `reset`: the bar as the recorded fixes left it,
kept in its `musescore-check` entry (`scanned_from`), which is the `from` a new fix for
it needs, because fixes replay **before** the check. An `append` spells what it adds by
the key in force (flats in a flat key). And cleans take turns (`pipeline._CLEAN_LOCK`):
`clean_score`'s `GLOBALS` is one per process, and two songs cleaning at once emptied
each other's tables — a clean failed with the bare error `"3"` (`KeyError: 3`); a failed
job now names an unexpected error's type.

**A bar a fix has answered stops showing red** (#347). homr marks a printed staff, so
on a staff two parts share the `⚠` mark lands on the first part while the red notes stay
on both. `unmark` and the word-striking picks (`pitch`, `rhythm`, `bar`) therefore look
for the mark on every part that printed staff became in that bar (`score_fixes._siblings`,
read off `lyricsSystemMap` / `lyricsStaffMap`); `tie`/`untie` answer `tie?`,
`slur`/`unslur` answer `slur?` and `duration` answers `rhythm?`; and after any fix, a bar
with no mark left on any of those parts loses its red notes (`_settle`). `voice?` and
cleaning's own sentences still need an `unmark`, as #290 decided. Cleaning no longer
copies the marks into `fixes.json` as `clean-marker` text entries — the Fix panel reads
them off the score — and removes copies an older clean left.

`untie` (#342, `index`, `pitch`) is `tie` taken back: it takes out the tie that starts on
that note, both halves, in this bar or across the barline, so playback sings the note
again. Strophic songs print **dashed** ties that belong to a later verse only, and homr
reads them as real ties, so verse 1 loses a syllable (Gaudeamus igitur bars 6 and 8).
Strict about `from` like the others, and replayed on every clean.

`delete` (#352, `index`, `what`, optional `subtype`, `from`) takes a mark the scan invented
off one chord — a fermata (Mieslaulu bar 13 has two where the page prints staccato
dots), an articulation, an arpeggio (#366: a sharp read as one), a breath mark, a staff text, a tempo or a rehearsal mark. Only
those: a slur, tie, note, red mark or the words are refused naming the kind that does
it, and a clef, key, meter or triplet bracket because it changes the bar itself.
MuseScore holds a beat for **any** staff's fermata, so the log says when another staff
still carries one at that beat. `GET /bar` lists each chord's `marks`.

`delbar` (#346, `measure`, `from`) takes out a bar the scan invented, on every staff —
Kun poijat ne raitilla's scan put an empty bar between the "1." and "2." endings, so
the "1." bracket covered two bars and the track played a bar of silence. A volta, slur
or tie reaching across the bar is shortened by one, both halves, a "1." bracket that
ends on the barline before it keeps its length, the removed-slur records (`removedSlurs`) move up with their bars, and a per-system lyric map loses the
bar too; a spanner starting or ending in it, any volta starting in it, a repeat sign,
or a clef/key/meter change refuses. Fixes apply **in file order**: an entry before a
`delbar` counts bars with the invented one still there, an entry after it without, so
neither has to be renumbered; a Fix-panel pick is relocated (`relocate_picks`) in that numbering too, and the bars homr offered readings of are numbered off the scan, so `offers` maps them past the moved bars (`score_fixes.after_moves`). The printed-system bar labels (`.systems.json`) and the
line breaks the previews take off the converted input still count the invented bar.

`insbar` (#346, `measure`, `from`) is the other way round, for a barline the scan
lost (Kristallen den fina squeezed printed bars 2-4 into cleaned bars 3-4): an empty
bar, a whole-bar rest in the meter in force, goes in **after** bar `measure` on every
staff, for `bar` fixes later in the file to write (a `bar` fix now writes a bar that
holds only a whole-bar rest, and a `bar` rewrite now keeps a volta bracket's halves in the bar). `from` is what bar `measure` reads now. A slur or volta
across that barline is lengthened, a volta ending on it keeps its length, a tie across
it refuses, and the metaTags move as for `delbar`. Both count in file order, and the
Fix panel maps bars through both (`score_fixes.bar_moves`) — homr's offers, picks, and the slur answers it matches by bar-numbered id (`problems._slur_decisions`).

`dropnote` and `addnote` (#358, `index`, `pitch`, `from`) take one note off a chord or
put one on, and leave its length, words and other notes alone. Pages print an optional
note in brackets — a low octave, a divisi — and homr reads it as a real chord note, so
the track sang both; **the default is to sing the main note only**, so the bracketed
head is dropped and an optional note the scan missed stays out (owner's call on #358).
`dropnote` also takes out a tie on the note, both halves, and refuses a chord's only
note; `addnote` spells the note from `tpc`, an octave in the chord, or the key in force.

`unvolta` (#378, `measure`, optional `text`) and `unrepeat` (`measure`, `which`: `end` or
`start`) take out a volta bracket or a repeat sign the scan invented, on every staff, both
halves of a bracket; each refuses when there is nothing to take. Suomalainen rukous came
back with the organ's "1." ending and end repeat copied onto an extra bar, and the scroll
render refused it. `volta` takes `second`, the bars of the "2." ending (a bracket may now
close the score), and `barlen` (`measure`, `from`, `to`) gives a bar every staff rests
through another length (`len`), for a 2nd ending printed 6/4 that cleaning cut to 4/4.

`timesig` (#353, `measure`, `from`, `to`) takes a time signature the scan invented off
every staff (`"to": null`) or writes another in its place (`"to": "6/8"`). Kesäaamu is
printed in 6/8 and homr read a 3/4 at bar 22; the notes fit both, so `spurious_timesigs`
cannot see it. Only a change that keeps the bar's length is allowed (3/4 and 6/8, or a
removal where the meter in force is that length), bar 1 refuses, and it counts bars in
file order like `delbar`.

A further kind, `text`, is just a sentence (`{"kind": "text", "what": "..."}`), because
most edits are none of the other three — turning a bar-length rest into a whole-bar
rest came up on one song in one sitting and could not be written down at all. Nothing interprets it: `apply_fixes` steps over
it and `score_fixes.free_text` hands the sentences back, so cleaning logs them as still
outstanding and the **Fix** panel lists them (`pipeline.free_text_fixes`, read live off
the file, so writing one shows at once and applying it stops showing). Applying one is
a person's job, or an agent asked to do it. Refusing to clean would make the file a
hostage; skipping in silence is the failure it exists to prevent.

Writing an entry has meant hand-editing the JSON, which means knowing the token
grammar and the staff/measure/index numbering — and nobody does that from a phone.
This pull request proposes that the **Fix** panel record a `slur` without any of
that: pick the part, the bar and the two notes, say why. The judgement still has to
come from a person reading the page — a slur joins different pitches, so nothing
upstream will guess one back — but the recording no longer does. `score_fixes.read_bar`
reads the bar back out in the same numbering and the same tokens a fix writes, so what
is shown and what is recorded cannot drift apart, and `pipeline.record_slur_fix`
appends the entry *and* applies it to the cleaned score. Both, because either alone
fails: recorded-not-applied leaves the score looking unrepaired until the next clean,
and applied-not-recorded is the hand edit this file exists to replace. Only the new
entry is applied — `slur` is not idempotent, so replaying the file would double every
earlier one. The wrong repair people reach for instead is an empty syllable (`_`) in
the lyric editor, which patches the words while the score still says two attacks: the
video lights the second note, the grid keeps offering the slot, `slot_counts` keeps
counting it, and none of it survives a re-clean.

```bash
fixtures/virta-venhetta-vie/reset.sh        # drop it into songs/ at the furthest stage
fixtures/virta-venhetta-vie/reset.sh 00     # or: just registered, ready to clean
.venv/bin/python fixtures/virta-venhetta-vie/build.py   # regenerate the derived stages
```

Stages are overlays holding only what they add, so the 745 KB scan is stored once.
It now runs clean the whole way: **no health issues, no lyric mismatches**, and it
reaches stage `review` — which means every automatic check is satisfied, not that
the song is right. Nobody has compared it against the page end to end, the words and
their alignment are unverified, and **record** and **upload** have never been run on
it. See STEPS.md, "What clean does not mean". Two things needed a person to read the page, and both are
recorded in `fixes.json` with their reasoning — a dot the OCR invented in m26, and a
slur it dropped in m50. A third case needed no score edit at all: in m32 the bass
lower voice holds one syllable while the others sing two, which is a rhythm
difference and was fixed in the text. `STEPS.md` records how each stage
was produced, including a wrong conclusion and its correction — worth reading before
trusting a tidy-looking diagnosis of a scanned score.

### The OMR benchmark's public-domain slice

`fixtures/omr-benchmark/` is added by this pull request: three real scanned pages the
scanning code can be tested against, and the one page with **note-level ground truth**.
Everything #92's map concluded rested on `~/omr-benchmark/`, which is host state — a
fresh clone had none of it and CI could not run against real music, so #111 tested
flattening against synthetic documents in the shapes homr produced. Three of the seven
benchmark pages are public domain and those travel; the in-copyright ones (Fazer,
Breitkopf, Fennica Gehrman, Sulasol), their parses and the benchmark's `out/` stay on
the host, which remains the fuller set and where judging happens.

`pages.json` is the file of record — ids, page numbers, printed staff counts, and
system bounds as fractions of page height, the same units `.systems.json` uses.
`src/song_app/tests/benchmark.py` reads it so no test knows its layout. **B2 has no
file of its own**: page 2 of `fixtures/virta-venhetta-vie/00-registered/` *is* that
page, so the manifest points at it rather than committing the same paper twice. B1a and
B1b are the same printed page at 287 dpi and at 150 dpi with dropout, so scan quality
is isolated from everything else. **Only PDFs are committed** — the tests rasterise with
poppler, and a 300 dpi PNG of one of these pages is 1.0–1.7 MB on its own.

Two things about the truth, both pinned by tests. It is **derived, so it is
re-derived**: `test_the_truth_table_is_what_the_transcription_says` rebuilds the CSV's
120 note events out of the hand transcription bar by bar, which is what makes it
evidence rather than a claim. And the page boundary — bars 11–17, systems 11–13 /
14–15 / 16–17 — comes from the transcription's own page and line breaks, not from
counting bars off a scan. One exception a scoring rule has to allow for: in bar 15 the
two basses are in unison and the print has a single line, so the truth is one voice.

See `fixtures/omr-benchmark/README.md`.

### Working in a worktree (agents, read this first)

An issue worker gets a fresh worktree under `.worktrees/issue-N`, and a fresh worktree
has **no `.venv`, no `.env` and no `songs/`** — all three are gitignored and live only
in the main checkout at `~/musescore-choir-plugins`. Interactive sessions use their own
worktree too (`git worktree add .worktrees/<topic> -b <branch> origin/main`), never that
shared checkout: several sessions share it, and a dirty one blocks the deploy timer. Without them nothing runs: there is
no interpreter with lxml in it, `MUSESCORE_CLI_PATH` is unset, and the app has no songs.
Link them in before doing anything else:

```bash
for f in .venv .env songs; do ln -sfn ~/musescore-choir-plugins/"$f" "$f"; done
```

`songs/` is the **real** song folders, shared with the running app — a re-clean or a
rename inside a worktree changes the songs you actually sing. Read them freely; write
to one only when the issue is about that song, and say so in the PR. Tests never need
it: they build their own songs in a tmp dir and read `fixtures/` from the worktree.

### Tests

**While working, run only the tests related to what you changed.** The whole suite
is CI's job, not yours:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest src/song_app/tests/test_scroll_preview.py -q   # one module
.venv/bin/python -m pytest src/scrollvideo/tests/ -q                      # one package
```

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs everything on every pull request and every push to
`main`, in two parallel jobs (the suite, and the browser tests on their own), and
finishes in **2–3 minutes**. The same run locally takes **8+ minutes** on this host —
it is serial, and `src/scrollvideo/tests/test_preview.py` alone is over half of it
because each of its tests shells out to MuseScore. Running it before every PR was the
habit from before CI existed (added 2026-08-25); there is no reason to keep paying it.

So: **verify your change with its own tests, push, and read CI.** Cite the CI run in
the PR body rather than a local "full suite passed" count.

Two things follow from that, because **nothing is gated**. `main` has no branch
protection and no required checks — deliberately, this is a one-person project merged
by hand — and `scripts/deploy-song-app.sh` runs no tests, so a merge is on the live
app within two minutes. **Check CI is green before commenting `/merge`.** It is the
only thing that ran the suite, and nothing will stop you merging while it is red or
still running.

The full run is still the right thing before a release you are nervous about, or when
you have touched something with reach (`lyric_txt.py`, `main.py`, `build.py`):

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest src/clean_score/tests/ src/song_app/tests/ src/scrollvideo/tests/ -q
# 467 passed              — with poppler, Playwright and MUSESCORE_CLI_PATH all set
# fewer                   — without Playwright the browser tests skip; without
#                           poppler the pdf_systems and bounds tests skip; without
#                           a MuseScore CLI the scrollvideo sync tests skip too
```

**A poller verification job leaves the browser tests to CI** (agentdeck#2709). Submit
the full run with `-m "not browser and not omr"` and let it run on this host:

```bash
agentdeck job submit --verification ... -- .venv/bin/python -m pytest src/clean_score/tests/ src/song_app/tests/ src/scrollvideo/tests/ -q -m "not browser and not omr"
```

The Playwright tests are the slow part, and CI's `Browser tests` job already runs them
on the same commit. The poller's release waits for every GitHub check on the head it
merges, and a red one gets a repair turn, so CI covers them; the local job does not
need to.
`not omr` keeps homr off this host: the `omr` tests run it on real scans, and CI,
which has no homr, skips them too.

One trap when timing or trusting it: the scrollvideo tests call the MuseScore CLI
under a timeout, so anything else heavy running on the host at the same time makes
them fail for no reason of their own. Two `test_preview.py` failures chased in this
way turned out to be a concurrent job starving them; they pass in seconds alone.

The six extra are **browser tests** (`src/song_app/tests/test_ui_flow.py`, Playwright),
marked `browser`. They need a two-step install, and the module skips unless **both**
steps are done — the pip package alone is not enough, so a half install still skips
rather than erroring:

```bash
.venv/bin/pip install pytest-playwright
.venv/bin/playwright install chromium      # ~95 MB, into ~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright

.venv/bin/python -m pytest ... -m "not browser"   # skip them even when installed
```

`pyproject.toml` sets `log_cli_level=DEBUG` and registers the `browser` marker.
Key test modules:

- `test_lyric_txt_spanner.py` — asserts lyric export→import round-trips back to
  the original XML (the real behavioral coverage), driven through `export_lyrics` /
  `place_lyrics`.
- `test_json_staff_mapping.py` — lyric **routing**: builds a synthetic score, places
  a PDF-derived line, and reads back which output staff got the words (printed
  staff+position, per-system map, part names, explicit `parts` override).
- `test_lyric_diagnostics.py` — the structured `Mismatch` fields, measure_start
  inference, and the editor-grid → cells → blocks → import → editor-grid round trip.
- `test_lyric_hyphenation.py` — a word split by a barline stays one word. The JSON
  import cuts a line into per-measure chunks and writes each back out as text in
  between, and that text could say "carries on into the next measure" but not
  "carries on from the previous one", so every chunk starting mid-word was read as a
  fresh word. Four of the five fail without the fix; the fifth is the guard that a
  word inside one measure is untouched.
- `src/clean_score/tests/scorebuilder.py` — the shared synthetic-score helper those
  two use (not a test module).
- `test_simple1_split.py` — a **golden-file snapshot** test: it runs the split
  pipeline on `test_files/<name>_input.mscx` and compares the element-tag
  sequence against `<name>_output.mscx`. If you intentionally change pipeline
  output, regenerate the goldens by copying the freshly produced
  `<name>_test_output.mscx` over `<name>_output.mscx`. The comparison is
  shallow (tags only, not text/attributes).
- `test_per_system.py` — drives the per-system module's own interface against the
  real `laulun_aika.mscx` fixture (systems, layout, part order, per-system pull,
  tuplet survival, line breaks, lyric map/metaTags, carried-forward answers, answer
  persistence) and pins both assignment adapters — the CLI prompt and grid answers —
  to the same rebuild.
- `src/song_app/tests/test_omr.py` — added by this pull request. Most of it drives a
  stub standing in for homr, because what `omr.py` owns is the boundary: where the
  binary is found, that the MusicXML lands where the caller asked and the teaser
  litter does not follow it, that `--gpu no` is actually on the command line, that
  both streams reach the log, and that each way of failing says something — a bad
  exit, a clean exit with no file, a wedged run, a PDF handed in by mistake, homr not
  installed. It also pins the heavy slot: a page is read under one, held across the
  run rather than asked for and dropped; the label names the page; `queue=False`
  genuinely does not ask; and losing the lease mid-page stops the page *and* takes
  homr with it. The last test is the card's own acceptance and the only one that runs
  the real thing: a page of the scanned fixture rasterised at 300 dpi goes in and parseable
  MusicXML with parts, measures and notes comes out (~50s). It skips without homr or
  poppler, the same way the MuseScore-CLI and Playwright tests skip.
  A third half pins the **engines**: one install with no checkout beside it is one
  engine; a working copy and each of its git worktrees are engines labelled with the
  branch they have out now; a directory that is not a homr checkout is not one; there
  are no checkout engines without an install to borrow dependencies from; an engine
  that is not there is refused rather than quietly becoming the default; the weights
  are linked rather than downloaded again and a real file is never replaced; and the
  chosen engine's argv *and environment* are what read the page. `test_install_homr.py`
  pins the other end — the one venv, what it says about itself, and an explicit
  `HOMR_SOURCE` being its own label.
  The **slurs** half added for #113 moved to the fork with the repair (#144); what is
  left pins that the app passes homr's slurs through untouched and that a parse with
  nothing to change comes back byte for byte as homr wrote it.
  A third half is added for #164: the **whole-measure rests**. Most of it is little
  measures written note by note — a shared rest moves out, the notes behind it move back
  into the room it was taking (12 divisions, not 16, because the lost quarter rest is not
  invented back), a rest alone in its voice is left alone, a rest that is not a whole rest
  is left alone, a second shared rest gets a voice of its own too, the spare voice is
  reused from one bar to the next because MuseScore holds four to a staff, a chord moves
  with the note it is stacked on, and a measure with a `direction` among its notes is left
  alone. The acceptance runs on **a committed copy of the real parse**,
  `tests/test_files/shared_whole_rest.musicxml` — #130's bar, kept beside the test rather
  than read out of `songs/`, which is live and changed under that card once already. It
  asserts the bar stops overfilling and the bars either side of it are untouched. Then the
  seam: a parse with nothing to move comes back byte for byte, moving one twice finds
  nothing the second time, and `read_page` applies it, says so in the log, and hands the
  moves back to a caller that asked.
- `src/song_app/tests/test_omr_systems.py` — added by this pull request. Two halves.
  **Flattening** is tested with little documents in the shapes homr actually produced
  on the benchmark — four one-staff "Voice" parts, two two-staff "Piano" parts, and a
  mixture — so a fused grand staff still counts as two staves, the pair in the middle
  stays in the middle, the name is never read, and a staff comes out with its own clef,
  its own notes and its voices renumbered from 1. A group of them is about **where the
  notes land**, rewritten by this pull request for #172: two voices homr started together
  still start together, a voice homr wrote later in the bar stays later, a voice entering
  mid-bar enters mid-bar, a chord stays stacked on the note it shares a beat with, and the
  two staves of a fused part each start at the head of the bar. The last of those five is
  what the old rebuild was for; the other four are what it cost. Beside them is the
  acceptance on a **committed copy of a real parse**,
  `tests/test_files/voices_across_the_bar.musicxml` — one printed system of Herää Suomi as
  homr read it, kept beside the test rather than read out of `songs/` — asserting every
  note of it comes out on the beat homr put it on, and naming the bar the old rebuild
  moved a whole phrase in. A third group is added by this pull request for #187, about
  **which voice a note comes out on**: a voice homr wrote first does not become voice 1
  for it, a bar only the lower voice sings does not promote it, and a voice numbered 5 is
  still compacted, because compacting was never the defect. Beside them is that card's
  acceptance on two more **committed copies of real parses**,
  `tests/test_files/voice_rank_join_{first,second}.musicxml` — the two printed systems
  either side of one join of Kaksi laulua krapulasta 2, the join #173 measured losing 21
  points with every note present — asserting the higher singer holds voice 1 in every bar
  of both, and again once they are assembled into one part across the join. **Assembling** is
  tested on the seams: continuous bar numbers, a break at each join and none at the
  start, one `divisions` with the durations rescaled to it, a repeated key dropped and a
  changed one kept, a meter change inside a crop left alone, a resting column given the
  system's own bar length, and every part opening with something to read. The last test
  is the acceptance minus homr and the only one needing MuseScore: systems of 2, 3 and 2
  staves survive assembly, conversion and `per_system.system_layout` as those systems
  with those staves. Nothing here runs homr — whether it can read music is homr's
  business, and the card's own numbers came off the frozen benchmark, which is host
  state.
- `src/song_app/tests/test_scan.py` — added by this pull request, for the scan stage.
  Cropping and reading are stubbed (they belong to `pdf_systems` and `omr_systems`, and
  are pinned there), so what is under test is what this stage adds: that the band is
  padded and the padding is clamped to the page, that a failed band and a lost lease each
  cost only the band in flight while the rest are kept and the song stays on `scan`, that
  filling the hole re-reads only the hole, and then the whole invalidation chain — a
  moved band discarding its own fragment and answers and nobody else's, an inserted band
  making every later fragment fail to match the geometry now at its index, a re-read that
  came out different discarding that system's answers and the reviewer's approval, a
  re-read that came out the same discarding nothing, and a song that never scanned
  deriving nothing from any of it. Flattening and assembling are *not* stubbed: they are
  cheap, need no binary, and stubbing them would leave the seam a hole slips through.
  It also pins **leaving the stage** (#281, which removed the approval gate #116 added): a
  finished scan moves the song to Clean, a hole keeps it on Scan, a re-read that came out
  different leaves a song further on where it is (while still lapsing Review's approval),
  a re-read that leaves a hole sends it back, a song the old gate left on Scan moves on
  when read, an unmarked page is refused before any band is read while a missing poppler
  is not, and a hole has no fragment to render.
  It also gains the **record of a moved whole-measure rest** (#164): one is written down
  as an outstanding free-text fix naming the system, the bar and the voices; re-reading the
  same system does not say it twice; a re-read that moved nothing takes the sentence away;
  a sentence somebody typed is never touched; a system that could not be read records
  nothing; and a `fixes.json` broken by hand costs the record rather than the reading. The
  repair itself is not tested here — it belongs to `omr.py` and is pinned there.
  `test_fix_panel_ui.py` carries the browser end: the sentence a real scan would leave,
  written by `record_scan_repairs` rather than typed, showing on the Fix stage.
- `src/song_app/tests/test_scan_panel_ui.py` — added by this pull request: the Scan panel
  in a real browser, which is where most of #116 actually lives. It opens on the Systems
  editor with the Scan button waiting for the bands; a hole shows what homr said, offers a
  retry of its own and keeps the song on Scan; a whole reading moves the song to Clean with
  nothing to approve; and it all fits 390x844.
  Nothing here runs homr, poppler or MuseScore — the fragments are written into the song
  the way a scan would leave them, **with real band stamps**, or the app discards them all
  on the next read, which is the invalidation rule working rather than a test detail.
  It also pins the engine picker: hidden when one homr is installed, and when two are, the
  engine chosen in the browser is the binary `scan.run` is actually handed. And that a
  system which read fine can be read again — from the panel and from its compare row,
  each re-reading only the system named and saying what a changed reading costs.
- `src/song_app/tests/test_health_summary.py` and `test_health_findings_ui.py` — what
  is left of #170's verdict tests after #356 removed the verdict: the Review health row
  is a count and a warning with no verdict beside it and never a gate, a score with
  findings on most bars shows no banner on Review or Fix, the approve button still
  approves, and the Scan panel names the systems the findings fell in.
  `test_scan.py` carries the attribution itself — the bar-to-system mapping, a collapsed
  row shared over the bars it names rather than landing on the first, and the three ways
  of refusing to attribute at all.
- `src/song_app/tests/test_system_finder.py` — the grouping-rule tier moved to the fork
  with the rule (#144). **homr** (marked `omr`, ~70s): the acceptance,
  against the bands a person drew — the fixture's 15 across four pages and both Herää
  Suomi scans, each boundary within 0.02 of the hand-drawn one. The route and the button
  are pinned where they live: `test_bounds_api.py` (a proposal saves nothing, a page
  homr could not read is a 400 saying so) and `test_ui_flow.py` (the editor fills with
  the proposal, unsaved, and the song still holds what it held).
- `src/song_app/tests/test_benchmark.py` — added by this pull request, and the first
  thing in the suite that meets a **real scan**. Three tiers, so each dependency buys
  something and none is required. **No dependencies**: the manifest's files are on disk
  and its bounds are ordered non-overlapping bands whose bars run on; the truth table is
  re-derived from the hand transcription bar for bar; the page boundary is read off that
  transcription's own breaks; B2 is the song fixture's page rather than a second copy;
  and no PNG has crept in. **poppler**: each page crops into the bands its bounds name,
  each band wider than it is tall and holding a plausible amount of ink. **homr**
  (marked `omr`, ~3 minutes): both Herää Suomi scans and the Virta venhettä vie page
  read back as the staves the page prints and the bars the bounds declare — B1b at 150
  dpi with dropout has to match B1a — and B1a assembles into one 7-bar score with a
  break at each join. The last tier skips without homr or poppler, the same way the
  MuseScore-CLI and Playwright tests skip; CI has no homr and should not grow one.
  `benchmark.py` beside it is the manifest reader, not a test module.
- `src/song_app/tests/test_clean_flow.py` — the song-app path: grid answers →
  `save_system_answers` → headless `run_clean` → rebuilt parts + lyric routing.
- `src/song_app/tests/test_ui_flow.py` — the **SPA itself**, in a real browser: it
  starts the actual server on a free port with its own `songs/` folder and answer
  file, then walks New song → per-system grid → clean → manual lyric entry → import,
  and asserts the mismatch is attached to the cell that caused it. A second test pins
  the grid's answer rules (blank inherits, `-` clears, both flagged before cleaning).
  Score previews are switched off (`MUSESCORE_CLI_PATH` points at nothing) — the
  renderer is not under test and a real MuseScore run would make it slow and
  host-dependent. Both were verified by sabotage: breaking the cell attachment or the
  `-` rule in `app.js` fails the matching test.
- `test_shared_rests.py` / `src/song_app/tests/test_musescore_check.py` — added for
  #235. The first: a rest shared at the end or in the middle of a bar reaches both
  voices, a gap the other voice sings through or that its rests do not cover exactly is
  left, a rest in a triplet is not copied, and a second run changes nothing. The
  second: a reset bar is one whole-bar rest of the bar's own length naming the notes it
  held, the other staff and bars are untouched, a tie or slur into it is cut; the real
  MuseScore (skips without it) names a bar it refuses and accepts it once reset; no
  MuseScore is "not checked"; the sentence is written once, replaced on a re-clean,
  removed when the clean passes, and never touches a typed one.
- `test_cross_voice_slurs.py` / `test_long_bars.py` / `src/song_app/tests/test_clean_marks.py`
  — added for #238. A slur from one voice into the other loses both halves, is
  reported as one slur, marks both bars and gives the lower voice its syllable back,
  while a slur inside one voice is untouched. A bar an eighth too long comes back 4/4
  with the cut notes named in its mark; a note across the barline is shortened, a
  triplet across it goes whole, a voice off the beat grid is left short rather than
  padded wrong, a tie into the cut-away part goes, and short bars, bars printing their
  own signature and the bars either side are untouched. Then the marks: red, `⚠`,
  listed by health until deleted, said in the clean's log (no longer copied into
  `fixes.json`, #347), put on a bar MuseScore rejected, and absent from the
  video.
- `test_missing_ties.py` — a tie is copied onto a voice singing the donor's rhythm,
  not onto an ostinato on the same pitch (#284), not past a rhythm that differs
  before the tie ends, and not between two pitches; any matching donor will do.
- `test_missing_tuplets.py` — the dropped-tuplet cross-voice auto-fix (mirror
  within/across staves; well-formed and donor-less voices left untouched).
- `test_revoice.py` / `test_interactive.py` — the re-voicing plan and the
  non-interactive anomaly reduction.
- `src/song_app/tests/test_repeat_question.py` / `test_repeat_question_ui.py` — added
  for #312: an end repeat with no start is asked about once, with the printed systems
  in between as its choices; a pick puts a start sign on every staff and comes back on
  a re-clean; **a** leaves the score alone and stays answered; the `repeat` kind
  refuses a bar that already opens one. The browser half is the card on a phone.
  `test_omr_systems.py` carries the assembly half (a sign read on some staves written
  on all, and MuseScore keeping it).
- `src/song_app/tests/test_volta_question.py` / `test_volta_question_ui.py` — added for
  #319: an end repeat with no bracket over it is asked about once, offering a "1."
  bracket of 1-4 bars (never reaching the repeat's own first bar) and "2." over the bar
  after; a pick writes both and comes back on a re-clean; **a** stays answered; the
  `volta` kind writes the same elements MuseScore wrote for Shakkitarina's hand-made
  brackets, refuses what it cannot draw, and (with MuseScore) exports as real endings.
- `test_unslur_tie_duration.py` — added for #340, on Annin laulu's own bars: a
  slur taken out loses both halves and gives the syllables back (a half written ahead
  of its chord too), a tie lands on both notes with MuseScore's own offsets and takes
  the held note's syllable, a double dot gives the 11/16 bar back its 3/4 on every
  staff while ties out of it keep their notes, a length no signature prints refuses,
  and (with MuseScore) the bar it had refused opens once the dot is back. `untie`
  (#342) takes both halves out across or inside a bar, gives the syllable back,
  leaves other ties alone, and replays on a rebuild.
- `test_delete_mark.py` — added for #352, on the shapes of Mieslaulu bar 13 and Annin
  laulu bar 19: the named fermata goes and the chord, its words and the bar's other
  fermata stay; every listed kind and `subtype`; each refused kind names its tool; a
  red mark points at `unmark`; strict `from`; the other staff's fermata said; replay
  on a rebuild; and (with MuseScore) the MIDI shortens only once both fermatas are out.
- `test_delbar.py` — added for #346: the bar goes on every staff, the "1." and "2."
  brackets close up round it, a slur across it keeps both notes, fixes count bars in
  file order, `from` is strict, a bar with music or a spanner end in it refuses, the
  per-system lyric map and the removed-slur records lose the bar, `insbar` puts an
  empty bar in with the same care (Kristallen's insert-then-delete in file order), the entry replays on a rebuild, and a pick recorded after it survives the next clean.
- `test_chord_notes.py` — added for #358: `dropnote` takes one note off and keeps the
  chord's length and words, a tie into or out of the note loses both halves, the last
  note refuses; `addnote` lands in pitch order spelt by an octave, the key or `tpc`, and
  ties nothing; both are strict about `from`, replay on a rebuild, and (with MuseScore)
  the score still opens.
- `test_duration_back_steps.py` — added for #344, on the shapes of Gute Nacht bar 6
  and Annin laulu bar 10: a `duration` fix that restores the bar takes the back-step out
  of the voices it squeezed, a tie after the step still reaches its note, a voice the
  step did not squeeze to the bar, a forward gap and another voice's tie are left
  alone, a `bar` fix writes over a gap (Integer vitae T2 bar 9) and still has to fill
  the bar, and (with MuseScore) every voice of the bar opens.
- `test_overlong_voice_bar.py` — added for #350, on Lasinkuultava laulu T1 bar 9: a
  voice false triplets made 7/6 long in 4/4 comes back from one `bar` fix filling the
  bar, the other tenor untouched; a total that fills neither refuses naming both, and
  (with MuseScore) the bar it refused opens.
- `test_timesig_fix.py` — added for #353: a `timesig` fix takes the signature off
  every staff and leaves the notes, writes 6/8 over 3/4 without 3/4's beaming, refuses
  a staff reading otherwise (changing none), bar 1, a missing `from` and a change of
  bar length, counts bars after a `delbar`, and replays on a rebuild.
- `test_unvolta_barlen.py` — added for #378, on Suomalainen rukous's shape: the
  invented bracket and repeat go, both halves, and the endings come back "1." over one
  bar and a 6/4 + 4/4 "2." closing the score; each kind's refusals; replay on a
  rebuild; and (with MuseScore) the export plays one repeat with those endings.
- `test_read_bar.py` / `src/song_app/tests/test_record_slur.py` /
  `test_slur_panel_ui.py` — added by this pull request for recording a missing slur
  from the app. The first pins that reading a bar and writing a fix agree: the index
  shown is the index the slur lands on, the token shown is the token an `append`
  entry would carry, and a note is named the way the page spells it (Eb, not D#).
  The second pins the pair — entry written *and* score changed, the bar losing a
  syllable, the entry replayed by `apply_recorded_fixes` on a rebuild — and that a
  refusal (no reason, a span past the bar, a slur already there) writes neither. The
  third is the browser: the bar shown as its own notes, the cost said before the
  write, the warning when lyrics are already imported, and that it fits a phone.
- `test_rhythm_fix.py` / `src/song_app/tests/test_bar_readings.py` /
  `test_reading_picker_ui.py` — added for #269. The first pins the `rhythm` fix on
  Legenda bar 25's bass: the picked lengths and triplet brackets, pitches and lyrics
  untouched, ties following their notes, the red mark gone, refusals. The second pins
  where an offer lands (bar number across systems, an octave-shifted tenor, doubled
  voices one staff each, a changed bar not offered), the pick and its replay, "none of
  these", and a pick lapsing when its system is read again. The third is the browser:
  options drawn, one tap picks, and it fits a phone.
- `src/song_app/tests/test_problems.py` / `test_problem_list_ui.py` — added for #290.
  The first pins the rows (one per bar and part, a mark and its health row said once,
  a dismissed mark staying hidden, a removed slur asked once on its first bar), the
  `pitch` pick and its replay (an octave-shifted tenor, a rhythm pick on the same bar
  not losing the pitch offer), and the slur answers (drawn across the barline, marks
  off, back after a re-clean, "no slur" adding nothing, refusals). The second is the
  browser: one card for a bar with both kinds of doubt, a slur answered in words, and
  a phone. A tap keeps the reader's place (#329): the next card lands where the
  answered one stood, desktop and phone, since a redraw otherwise left the panel at
  its bottom — including when a `state` ping redraws it again while or after the
  tap's list loads, which the file watcher sends after a pick some of the time. #295 rewrote their reading half around whole bars: the ranking, the second
  reading always **b**, picking it writing the bar afresh and coming back on a rebuild,
  an octave-shifted tenor, an earlier pick counting as decided, and in the browser six
  shown with the rest behind "More". `test_bar_fix.py` pins the `bar` kind itself.
- `src/song_app/tests/test_lyrics_live_ui.py` — added for #336: an import keeps the
  Lyrics panel's scroll, its boxes and the focus, through the watcher's `state` ping
  too; the warnings change in place; only the changed systems (and the blank-box
  systems a line spills into) are fetched again, the old picture kept under
  "Updating…" meanwhile; One system shows the words on the notes; and a phone keeps
  its place. Pictures and the import are `page.route` stubs, so no MuseScore.
- `src/song_app/tests/test_state_race.py` — added for #252. The file watcher used to
  save the whole song state it had loaded, so a lyric import that saved while the
  watcher was checking health was silently undone. It drives both interleavings (a
  copy loaded before the import, and the import landing mid-check) and asserts the
  import's `lyrics` record and stage survive. The rule it pins: `_rescan` writes only
  health and the fingerprint, onto the state re-read under `state.song_lock`, and
  every `Song.save` takes that lock and writes by rename.
- `src/song_app/tests/test_score_file.py` / `test_score_file_ui.py` — added by this
  pull request for taking the score away to MuseScore and bringing it back (#216).
  The first is mostly about what must **not** be replaced: a PDF, a transfer that
  truncated, MusicXML rather than MuseScore, a score with no music in it, a `.mscz`
  with nothing inside — each refused with the score on disk untouched — plus nothing
  replaced underneath a running job. Then the half that has to happen: the file comes
  down under its own name, a `.mscx` and a `.mscz` both land, the health record is
  re-taken against what arrived, and an approval given against the old score lapses.
  The second is the browser: the download really saves under the score's name, a
  picked file reaches disk and the panel still says so after its own refresh, and a
  refusal is said in the panel rather than only to a log nobody has open. Neither
  needs MuseScore. Screenshots go to `EVIDENCE_DIR` when the run names one, so none
  is committed here.

## Where an OMR fix belongs: the fork or this repo

Scanning is split across two repositories — `eerovil/homr` (the fork) and this one —
and until this pull request there was no written rule saying which gets a given fix.
One was being followed consistently enough to be real and inconsistently enough that
"why is this here?" had a different answer per case. This section is that rule,
proposed by this pull request and settled on #141. This file carries the full
reasoning; the fork's `README.md` carries a short statement of the rule ("About this
fork", merged as `eerovil/homr#22`).

`/merge` on a card here releases a fork pull request too, as long as its description
names the card in full (`eerovil/musescore-choir-plugins#<n>` or the issue URL; a bare
`#<n>` does not count). It goes through the same review and test gates and is not
merged by hand.

**The fork is a permanent home we own.** Not a staging area, not a waiting room on the
way upstream. `scripts/install-homr.sh` installs it and a second host reproduces it by
running that one script, which is the whole story — there is no plan for the fork to
be retired or emptied.

**The rule.** homr's job is to produce MusicXML that, **when rendered, looks like the
original PDF** — including stem direction, which is to say the voices. Anything after
that point is the choir app's.

So: if homr got the page wrong, the fix is the fork's, whether or not the evidence is
still in the pixels. If the parse matches the page and we want something else from it —
a stage, an operator's judgement, a practice track — that is ours. The rule is a claim
about the *output*, which makes it testable: render the MusicXML and hold it against
the page.

That is deliberately wider than "can the fix be made without the pixels?", which is
what had been operating. Under the old reading a defect visible in the MusicXML could
be repaired in either place and the call went both ways for reasons that lived only in
commit messages. Under this one it cannot: a runaway slur is not on the page, so it is
homr's to not emit.

**Which means this repo's OMR boundary layer was drift, and #144 moved it.** Slur
pairing (`omr.resolve_slurs`), per-system reading and the system finder are all "make the
parse match the page", so all three were ported into the fork (eerovil/homr#62, #63,
#65). Once the fork was installed here (`main @ 7652330`) and re-measured on 21 printed
systems, #144 took the app's copies of the **slur repair** and the **system finder's
grouping rule** out: the old slur pass dropped nothing on the fork's output, and *Find
systems* now only asks homr (`--find-system-bounds`). A homr older than that fork is
refused for *Find systems* and its slurs go unrepaired — update it rather than reviving
the copies. **The per-system cropping stays in `omr_systems`, and #223 measured why.**
homr's own `--system-bounds` mode cuts the same padded band at the same dpi with the
same pixel rounding; the one difference is the rasteriser (pypdfium where the app uses
poppler). Re-measured on the fork after the upstream sync (`main @ 8512194`, 200 dpi,
2% pad) with `scripts/system_bounds_vs_crop.py`, on the Virta fixture's 15 systems and
B1a/B1b's 3 each: staves and bars agree on 21/21, the parses are identical on only 4,
note counts differ by at most one per system, and against B1's hand transcription
(onsets only — it writes every notehead as a C) the app's crop gets **107/120** onsets
on B1a against homr's **106**, and **88/120** on B1b both ways, with homr's crop losing
one slur on B1a system 2. The card's rule was to switch only if homr's route was at
least as good, and it is not, so nothing moved. The gap is at noise level, so this is
worth measuring again when a new scanned fixture with note-level truth exists — the
script reuses reads it already has under `--out`.

**`clean_score`'s OCR repairs are the known tension.** `fix_missing_tuplets`,
`fix_spurious_timesigs`, `fix_overfull_measures`, `add_missing_ties` and the recorded
edits in `fixes.json` all exist to make a score match its printed page, so in principle
they are the fork's too. In practice they are not moving: they predate homr, they run on
scores that never went through it — imported MusicXML, the songs already in `songs/` —
and homr has no equivalent of a human-authorised `fixes.json` entry. Recorded here as a
tension rather than as a plan, so nobody acts on the principle without the context.

**The fork follows upstream and takes all of it.** This replaces #158's rule that
upstream is "a source of ideas rather than truth", and the owner changed it on #220: we
do not pick commits out of `liebharc/homr` `main` or judge each one on our pages first —
**every upstream commit is merged, new models included**, and the fork's own commits sit
on top. A sync is one `git merge upstream/main` into the fork (so `git log` says which
upstream commit the fork is on), and it is a card like #220, started when upstream moves.
The harness still measures what a sync did to our repertoire, but **it reports; it does
not decide**: #220 took model 465 although it read three of the five fixtures worse than
model 426 had (`sammon-ryosto` 98% → 41%), and lowered their accepted levels rather than
refuse the model.

Where upstream and the fork changed the same code, the resolution takes **upstream's
version** unless the fork's is something upstream has no equivalent for. #220 is the
example both ways: the note-timing fix upstream wrote for the bug the fork had fixed
itself (df36447 against the fork's per-staff cursors) replaced the fork's, while the
fork's voice, stem and system-bounds work, which upstream has nothing like, stayed and was
wired to upstream's new second-voice tokens (`upper2`/`lower2`).

#130's warning still stands as a fact about the past — upstream `main` once measured worse
on this repertoire than a pinned release, and broke `scripts/install-homr.sh` by moving
onnxruntime into a `[cpu]` extra — which is why a sync is measured and the numbers are
published on its pull request. It is no longer a reason to stay behind.

**Upstreaming our own changes is opportunistic: no obligation, no backlog.** If a fork
commit is clean and somebody feels like sending it, good — nothing is tracked, nothing is
owed, and no decision here ever waits on upstream review.

**The harness stays in the fork.** `fixturecheck/`, `choir-bench.py`,
`choir-worktree.sh` and `choir-k8s.sh` have to run inside homr's venv against a homr
worktree, which this repo deliberately never has. They reach back here through
`CHOIR_REPO` for the fixtures and cleaned scores they judge against, which is the right
direction of dependency: the thing being measured reaches for the truth. The cost is
worth saying — that is about a third of the diverging commits, so the fork can never
again "carry nothing of its own", and running the harness needs both repositories
present.

## The song web app (`src/song_app/`)

A local **FastAPI** web app (launched by `./song.py`, served at `localhost:8000`)
that unifies the workflow behind one state-aware door. It is a **thin frontend
over the existing scripts** — it adds no musical logic; it shells out to
`clean_score` (`main()`), `lyric_txt` (`import_file`), and `record_stemmanauha`
(`create_video.run`), and drives MuseScore via `open -a`. Full rationale and the
state model are in `DESIGN.md`.

- **Before working a song, check its source.** Song input scores come from Soundslice plus
  hand fixes, so a reference built from a cleaned score is not ground truth: treat any
  homr-vs-reference disagreement as a candidate and check it against the printed band.
  Check that the input in `.song.json` is the raw import ("Track N" part names, crowded
  voices, partial lyrics), not a finished score beside it; cross-check it bar by bar
  (allowing a small offset) against another copy in `songs/`; and assume OCR lyrics are
  mojibake and read the words off the page.
- **A Song** = a folder `songs/<slug>/` plus `.song.json` (the state file *is* the
  UX). `state.py` owns the slug, the human display name, the stage machine
  (`register → scan → clean → fix → lyrics → review → record → upload`), and file
  fingerprints. Recording produces the per-voice videos; **upload** (YouTube) is a
  separate stage, so a song can be "recorded but not yet uploaded". The folder is
  a slug; the display name lives in the JSON.
- `pipeline.py` is the glue: `convert_to_mscx` (mscx as-is / mscz unzip / xml via
  MuseScore CLI), `run_clean` (calls `main(..., interactive=False)`; per-system runs off
  the answers the **grid form** recorded via `save_system_answers`), and
  `run_lyric_import` (calls `import_file` and returns its `LyricImport` — the
  mismatches come back as records, nothing is scraped from stderr). `system_grid` / `save_system_answers` /
  `has_system_answers` / `system_ranges` are one-liners over the per-system module's
  interface (`layout_for_file`, `save_answers`, `has_answers`, `system_ranges`) —
  the grid is an adapter, not a second implementation.
  `render_score_pdf` exports a `.mscx` to PDF via the MuseScore CLI (cached by
  mtime) so scores can be shown in-browser next to the original PDF — it renders
  from a temp copy with the staff size (`<Spatium>`) shrunk by `SPATIUM_SCALE`
  (env `RENDER_SPATIUM_SCALE`, default 0.65) so the score's own system breaks fit
  the page instead of MuseScore adding extra ones. For the cleaned previews it
  also **puts the printed line breaks back** (`line_break_measures` reads them off
  the converted input, `_apply_line_breaks` writes them onto the top staff), because
  normal-mode cleaning strips them and the preview otherwise reflows into
  MuseScore's own systems and cannot be read against the page. On the fixture this
  renders the fixture's systems exactly as printed. Breaks alone are not enough to
  guarantee that: at full staff size a system too wide for the page is split anyway
  and MuseScore adds a break the page never had — the fixture's lyric-applied score
  comes out as 17 systems instead of 15. So the render **tries the scales in
  `BREAK_SCALES` (0.85, 0.75, 0.65) largest first and checks the result**, using the
  biggest staff that keeps the printed system count. Lyrics matter to that: they
  widen the spacing, so a score that fits at full size without them may not with
  them. Not every
  source has breaks; without them the render is unchanged. They are applied by
  measure index, so nothing is applied unless the score is long enough, and the
  two variants cache to separate files (`.render.pdf` / `.breaks.render.pdf`);
  **The breaks are moved into the cleaned numbering** (`cleaned_line_breaks`, #354):
  the converted input still counts a bar a `delbar` took out, so applied as read,
  every system after it started a bar late. The render's cache is keyed on the breaks
  too (a `.key` file beside it, with `RENDER_VERSION`), since a recorded fix moves the
  breaks without the cleaned score's mtime saying so.
  `strip_lyrics_copy` writes a lyrics-removed copy (cached) so the "Cleaned MSCX"
  (no-lyrics) view always reflects the live structure rather than a stale snapshot.
- `pdf_systems.py` cuts the **original PDF** into one image per printed system, so
  the score can be read at a resolution where a slur or a lyric line under the lower
  staff is actually visible; a whole A4 rendered small enough to look at is not.
  Shells out to poppler (`pdftoppm`, `pdfinfo`) — not a pip dependency, so the
  Systems tab and the lyric crops are simply unavailable without it (tests skip).
  **Where the boundaries come from is deliberately not decided here.** Detecting
  them from the image was tried and removed: staff-line detection died at 0.5° of
  skew and 20% ink dropout, and grouping staves into systems relied on a
  left-margin bracket only some editions print — across nine real songs it agreed
  with the score twice. Instead an AI reads them off the page
  (`page_images(grid=True)` overlays a labelled percentage scale, which turns
  estimating coordinates into reading them) and a person corrects them by dragging
  in the **Systems** viewer tab; `system_finder.py` (below) can now propose them
  from homr's own staff detection, and it proposes into that same editor rather
  than writing anything. They live in `.systems.json` beside the song as
  fractions of page height, so they survive any change of resolution, and the app
  and an agent read the same file. `crop_systems` rasterises **only the band**
  (`pdftoppm -x -y -W -H`): a page at 400 dpi takes ~7s, one system 0.9s, and this
  is on the path where someone clicks a lyric cell and waits. A page's pixel size
  is read **with its rotation flag applied** (`_page_info`), because `pdfinfo` reports
  the stored size and `pdftoppm` renders the turned page: a landscape-stored page
  flagged 90° was cropped by the wrong height and homr read half of two systems
  (#272). `crop_version` adds a suffix to the crop and scan stamps of such a PDF only,
  so its old crops and fragments are discarded while every other song's stay. `label()` attaches
  each band's measure range from a score that still has its line breaks — the
  converted input, since normal-mode cleaning strips them — and **refuses when the
  counts disagree**, because a silently wrong alignment puts lyrics on the wrong
  measures while a missing one is visible at once. The server, never the browser,
  assigns indices and labels on save.
- `health.py` is **validation only** (never mutates): per voice it sums note/rest
  durations as exact whole-note `Fraction`s (so tuplets don't round-off) and flags
  `malformed-measure` (voice doesn't fill the bar), `extra-voices` (a staff
  measure with >1 note-bearing voice), and `unprinted-meter` — a bar every voice
  agrees on, at a length no printed time signature gives. **That last one is the
  only check that does not compare the score against itself**, and it exists
  because everything that does can be satisfied by a self-consistent wrong answer:
  a repair pass once "fixed" a 4/4 bar by padding every voice to 9/8, and health,
  the lyric arithmetic and the tests were all happy. Measure 1 is exempt (an
  anacrusis prints no signature), and so is a last bar that makes one full bar with that
  anacrusis (#353: Kesäaamu opens on a sixteenth in 6/8 and closes on 11/16) and an already-uneven bar is left to
  `malformed-measure` rather than reported twice. It also stays out of music with
  no meter to violate: a score carrying an oversized nominal in place of a
  signature (one here declares 16/2 — eight whole notes — for music printed
  without a meter). Across the 35 cleaned songs in `songs/` it reports ~35
  bars, concentrated in five scores; spot-checked, they are real — including a
  mixed-meter piece that silently changes bar length 16 times, i.e. dropped time
  signatures.
  **A score where most bars declare their own length used to switch the meter rule
  off, and this pull request proposes that it collapse the finding instead** (#124).
  The escape is not wrong to exist — Venematka overrides 20 of its 25 bars and would
  otherwise be reported 66 times for being what it is, which is the noise that trains
  an operator to ignore a check. But "carries a length override" is also what a badly
  parsed score looks like: `fix_overfull_measures` writes one onto every bar whose
  content contradicts the running signature, so the check turned itself off exactly
  when the score was worst. Benchmark page B6 crossed the 50% line **by being more
  wrong** — misreading an opening 5/4 as 3/4 needed an override on bars 1 and 2 of all
  four staves, and those eight carried it from 50% to 56% — and reported 3 issues
  where the same score judged on the same rules has 32. A score bought silence by
  being worse, which is this project's named failure occurring inside the checker.
  So the share now decides only **how the finding is said**: above the line the bars
  are counted into one `meter-collapsed` finding naming how many bars, the first one
  to look at, and the share itself. Venematka's 66 become one line, B6's 32 stay 32,
  and the two sides of the line are comparable rather than one of them blank. Nothing
  to count is nothing to say — a free-metered score that agrees with itself is still
  clean. The threshold stays at 0.5: across `songs/` every score's override share is
  ≤0.19 except Venematka's 0.76–0.80, so the line sits in an empty gap, and crossing
  it now costs presentation instead of silence. The summary's id carries the count
  (`meter-collapsed-66`), so dismissing "4 bars disagree" does not cover "6 bars
  disagree".
  **Collapsing the presentation is the point; collapsing the number would be the same
  bug one level up**, so the row carries `collapsed` as an integer and every count a
  person reads goes through `health.finding_count`, which weighs a row by what it
  stands for: the library badge (`state.to_summary`), the "N issue(s) to review" line
  the clean finishes on (`server._run_clean`), and the Review stage's health result
  (`verification.summary`, which also puts `open_count` / `row_count` /
  `collapsed_count` on the wire and says in its detail how many findings are behind
  the one line). Counting rows would have put B6 straight back where it started — "4
  open issue(s)" next to a per-system parse's 28. The cost is that Venematka's Review
  stage reads 81 rather than 16; that is the true number, and its detail says 66 of
  them are one line in the Fix panel. Missing notes that still fill the bar (a
  half-rest standing in for lost notes, e.g. the m18 case) are **not**
  tick-detectable — they surface as lyric syllable overflow at import. Missing
  slurs are undetectable and stay manual. `merge_issues` carries over `dismissed`
  status and marks vanished open issues `fixed` across re-scans (ids are stable:
  `malformed-m18-s2-v1`).
  **There is no verdict on the parse as a whole any more** (#356). #170 added one — "this
  parse looks unusable" once findings landed on more than a fifth of the bars — on the
  walk's 60-finding song. Once homr's `⚠` doubt marks (#245) were listed as findings it
  went off on most scanned songs whose notes were right: homr marks a bar it is merely
  unsure of, on purpose, so `slur?`, `tie?` and the rest filled the share (Nälkämaan
  laulu 69%, all slur questions). The owner had it removed outright rather than
  reweighted: the count, the Fix rows and the Scan panel's attribution below say enough.
  **At the Scan stage health is not knowable**: it needs a cleaned score, which is two
  stages along. What the scan stage gets instead is **attribution**: once a song has been cleaned, `scan.findings_by_system`
  maps each finding's bar to the printed system it fell in, and the panel names the
  worst systems directly above the buttons that re-read one. It answers `None` — not
  zeros — whenever the numbering cannot be trusted, because a wrong system number sends
  somebody to re-read music that was read correctly: no clean yet, a hole, fragments
  whose bar lengths no longer add up to the cleaned score, or a health record checked
  against an older one. That last is the same `checked_against` test `verification`
  calls stale, and it is not covered by the bar count — editing a score in MuseScore
  changes what is in the bars and not how many there are — so without it the panel
  would send somebody back to a system they had just repaired.
- `server.py`: REST routes under `/api/songs/...`, a per-slug WebSocket (`/ws/{slug}`)
  for streamed progress logs + `state` pings — `hub.emit` **never raises**, because a
  render runs for minutes in a worker thread while the browser may come and go, and a
  closed loop surfacing there used to abort work that was going fine — long tasks (clean/record) run in a
  thread executor with a thread-safe `hub.emit`. Recording is guarded by a
  **lock file** (`.recording.lock`, holding the server pid) so a second start
  (e.g. after a page refresh) gets a 409 instead of clashing with the running
  recording; a lock from a dead/old process is treated as stale and cleared.
  The record endpoint takes `audio_delay_ms` (merge sync offset), `redo_mp3` /
  `redo_video` (re-export / re-record selectively), `merge_only` (re-merge
  existing media with a new offset, no recording), and `upload_only` (upload the
  already-merged videos — the Upload stage, no recording); outputs are listed via
  `/media` and streamed (range-capable) from `/media/{name}` for in-browser
  review. YouTube uploads report live percentage via a `progress` WS message,
  are recorded into `record.uploads` (title/id/url) for review + delete/re-upload
  (`/youtube-delete`), use the human song name for titles, and remember used
  playlists globally in `.playlists.json` (`/api/playlists`). **Local videos can be
  freed after upload** (#371, `free_videos.py`, `POST /free-videos`, the Upload
  panel's *Free space* button, never automatic): each upload entry now records the
  file it sent (`file`, `size`, `mtime_ns`), a video counts as uploaded when its
  part has a `video_id` and (when stamped) the file is unchanged, and freeing asks
  YouTube (`confirm_uploads`: exists, processed, published after the file) and
  deletes nothing unless every video passes. It holds the song's job gate
  (`free`), keeps `uploads`, records `record.freed`, and a render clears it. **Which playlists a song is in can be
  changed after the upload** (#338, `playlists.py`): the Upload panel's *Playlists*
  list ticks each remembered playlist holding every one of the song's videos, read
  live from YouTube (the app never recorded the extra playlist, and YouTube's own
  app can edit one), and `POST /playlists` adds the missing videos or removes this
  song's items, never touching the song's own playlist. Per-song playlists
  ("… Stemmanauhat - <date>") are no longer remembered or offered. The song's display
  name is editable on the Start panel (`POST /rename`); if videos are already
  uploaded, it retitles them (and the playlist) on YouTube in the background via
  `rename_uploads` (each upload stores its `part`, so titles rebuild as
  "<new name> <part>"). The folder slug never changes. After an upload run that uploaded something,
  and after `/youtube-delete`, `site_refresh.refresh_stemmanauhat` dispatches the
  `eerovil/stemmanauhat` site's *Update Videos* workflow (#321): its own schedule
  runs only a few times a day, so a new song otherwise took hours to appear there.
  Off without `STEMMANAUHAT_DISPATCH_TOKEN` in `.env`; a failure is a log line and
  never fails the upload. All YouTube API calls go
  through `_with_retry`/`_execute` (`upload_to_youtube.py`): 429 / 5xx / rate-limit
  reasons are retried with exponential backoff + jitter (6 tries; the resumable
  upload's `next_chunk` resumes on retry), while a daily-quota 403 raises
  `QuotaExceeded` with a clear "try again after reset" message instead of looping.
  Legacy `songs/<name>/`
  folders from the old CLI workflow are adopted by `import_legacy()` (run on
  startup and via `POST /api/import` / the Library's "Import existing" button): it
  infers a `.song.json` from the files present — input score, `*_cleaned.mscx`
  (+ health scan), PDF, `lyrics.json`, merged `media/video/<name> *.mov` outputs,
  and per-system mode from the answer cache — and sets the stage accordingly
  (recorded→upload, cleaned→review, input→clean). It's idempotent and skips
  folders that already have a state file. There is also a **file watcher**
  (`watchfiles.awatch` on `songs/`) that re-runs the health check when a
  `*_cleaned.mscx` is saved in MuseScore (guarded by fingerprint so our own writes
  don't loop). Static SPA is mounted at `/` (so `/api/*` wins).
  **Freshness.** This pull request proposes sending `Cache-Control: no-cache` on
  every file the app serves — the SPA shell, `app.js`/`style.css` (via
  `RevalidatingStaticFiles`), the PDFs, the system crops and the videos. Sending
  no `Cache-Control` at all is not the same as forbidding caching: a browser
  given no instruction invents a freshness lifetime from `Last-Modified`, and
  Chrome on Android invents a generous one, so a phone kept serving old code and
  old video off its own disk until the browser was restarted (#34). `no-cache`
  is not `no-store` — the copy is kept and `FileResponse`'s ETag turns an
  unchanged file into a small 304, so this costs a round trip, not a download.
  Videos additionally carry a `?v=<mtime>-<size>` stamp in the URL
  `_media_list` hands out, because re-recording a part rewrites the same file
  name and an identical URL is the one thing revalidation cannot save you from
  once a range request is already cached.
- `static/` **slow pictures say so** (#303). A score tab is a MuseScore render and can
  take a minute: `mountPdf` shows a note with a running seconds count (`busyNote`) on a
  first build, keeps the old score under an "Updating…" badge on a rebuild, and says
  why when the server refuses. The engraved systems in Compare and Scan vs page are
  one MuseScore run each, so they wait in placeholders and are fetched by
  `slowQueue` in reading order, `SLOW_AT_ONCE` (2) at a time — asked for all at once
  they started a MuseScore per system and arrived at random. A system jumped to goes
  next. The queue belongs to the view and outlives a redraw (a scan redraws Scan vs
  page after every system it reads): a request in flight lands on the new placeholder
  rather than being dropped or started again, since dropping it would not stop the
  MuseScore run behind it. `test_loading_states_ui.py` pins it.
- `static/` **layout**: the page never scrolls — `html, body` are fixed to the
  window and every panel scrolls inside itself. `#app` takes what the header leaves
  (`flex: 1 1 auto; min-height: 0`) and the workspace grid fills it. It used to be
  `height: calc(100vh - 49px)`, a guess at the header's height, which overflows the
  moment the header is a pixel taller — a longer song name will do it — and then the
  whole page scrolls and the viewer is carried off-screen. Grid and flex items need
  the explicit `min-height: 0`, or they refuse to shrink below their content and
  `overflow: auto` never fires.
- `static/` **on a phone**: the three panes cannot share a 390px screen, so below the
  breakpoint the panel and the viewer are shown one at a time and a bar at the bottom
  switches between them (the current stage · Score). The stage list is the same
  left-hand sidebar as on desktop, slid in over the page by a ☰ in the header (#258);
  opening it adds a history entry, so Android's Back closes it instead of leaving the
  song. The bar, the ☰ and the drawer's backdrop are in the DOM at every
  width and the stylesheet hides them above the breakpoint — there is no width-sniffing
  in `app.js` that could disagree with the media query, and every mobile rule is
  additive, so the desktop layout is untouched.
  **The bar must never leave the screen**, and on an Android phone it did (#258) — not
  reproduced in an emulated phone, so the fix does not rest on one cause. The bar is
  pinned to the bottom of the window (`position: fixed`) with the workspace padded to
  leave room, rather than being the grid's last row; the page snaps back to the top if
  anything scrolls it (a field brought into view, the keyboard closing); the keyboard
  shrinks the page instead of covering it (`interactive-widget=resizes-content`); and
  the page cannot be pinch-zoomed below the breakpoint (`touch-action: pan-x pan-y`),
  since a zoomed page carries the bar off with it. The score zooms itself instead —
  pinch on it, or − / + / Fit in its tab row — redrawing the PDF at the new size
  (`zoomPdf`). Those buttons are deliberately not `.vtab`: `rendering_state.js`
  remembers a `.vtab` click as the document to reopen and replays it after every
  redraw, and its `MOBILE_PANES` list is the bar's tabs by position. The breakpoint is
  `max-width: 840px, max-height: 500px`; the second condition catches a phone held
  sideways, which is wider than the breakpoint but nothing like tall enough. Two
  things had to change beyond CSS: the viewer's "wait for layout" retry now stops
  while its pane is off-screen (an offscreen pane never gains width, so it was an
  endless `requestAnimationFrame` loop on a battery) and wakes via `_wake()` when the
  pane comes back; and the Systems editor's band drag moved from mouse events to
  **pointer** events with capture, so a finger can drag a boundary — that path is
  otherwise unreachable on a phone. `src/song_app/tests/test_mobile_ui.py` drives it
  at 390x844.
- `static/` is a dependency-free vanilla-JS SPA: a library view and a 3-pane
  workspace (stage rail · per-stage panel · document viewer, controls clustered
  left, previews right). The viewer tabs
  between **Original PDF**, **Original XML** (the OCR input), **Cleaned MSCX**
  (lyrics stripped) and **Cleaned MSCX with lyrics** — all but the first are
  MuseScore-rendered PDFs served by `/render?doc=original|cleaned_nolyrics|cleaned`,
  cache-busted by the cleaned fingerprint so they refresh after re-clean / lyric
  import. The viewer can **split into two independent side-by-side panes** (the
  ⇆ Split control), each picking any doc — e.g. Original PDF next to Original XML.
  PDFs are rendered with **pdf.js** (CDN, `renderPdf`) into our own scrollable
  `<div>` so **scroll position survives a re-render** (after a re-clean / lyric
  import the cleaned preview re-renders in place and restores `scrollTop`); falls
  back to a native `<iframe>` if pdf.js can't load (offline). **PDF measure-locating
  is page-level only** (no bounding boxes) — see DESIGN.md.
- The **New song form** is the front door of the whole scan route, and this pull
  request proposes opening it (#127). `POST /api/songs` has taken a name plus
  *either* a score *or* a PDF since #98, and a PDF alone starts the song at `scan` —
  but `newSongDialog` refused to submit without a score file, so none of the 48 songs
  on the host had ever been through scanning: the route was live on the server and
  unreachable from the phone. The Scan panel work (#115, #116) edited `app.js` and
  never this dialog. So the form now asks for **name plus at least one file**,
  matching the server, and **leads with the PDF** — a song made from a PDF is the
  ordinary case and a score file is the manual import (#86). It also says **where
  each door goes** before Create is pressed (`.routehint`, live as the files are
  chosen): a PDF alone starts at Scan, a score file starts at Clean and skips
  scanning. Discovering that from the stage rail afterwards is discovering it too
  late — the scan is the stage that reads the page, and a song that skipped it looks
  exactly like one that passed it. The two file inputs carry ids (`#f-pdf`, `#f-xml`)
  because the browser tests used to reach the score as "the first file input", which
  reordering would have silently repointed at the PDF.
- The Lyrics panel's **Type by system** mode divides by the *printed* systems from
  `.systems.json`, not by the score's line breaks: normal-mode cleaning strips those,
  so the editor used to offer one cell per part covering the whole piece and only
  ever worked for per-system scores. `editor_grid(root, systems=[(start, end), ...])`
  takes the ranges; unlabelled bounds are refused and it falls back to the score.
  Focusing a cell shows that system in the viewer's **One system** tab (only the
  first pane follows the cursor, so a split can keep another document in view); a
  small inline crop above each block is available too, off by default.
- The Lyrics panel has two client-side modes (remembered in `localStorage`):
  **Paste from AI** keeps the prompt/JSON round-trip, while **Type by system**
  fetches `/lyric-grid` (`lyric_txt.editor_grid(...).to_dict()`) and renders a
  textarea for every `(printed system, output part)` — parts, systems and the
  prefilled text all come from the lyric module, not from `server.py`. The browser
  POSTs the raw cells (`{"cells": {system: {part: text}}}`); the server turns them
  into name-addressed JSON blocks with `blocks_from_cells` (`parts: [part name]`,
  `measure_start: system start`), writes them to `lyrics.json`, and runs the same
  importer as the paste mode. Mismatches come back as **fields** (`kind`,
  `measure_start`, `measure_end`, `staff_ids`, `syllables`, `slots`, `message`) and
  are attached to the matching system/part cell by comparing those fields — the
  browser no longer parses warning prose (a song whose `.song.json` predates this holds
  the sentence as a string; the panel reads the fields back out of it). **An import
  does not redraw the panel** (#336): it sets `panel._refreshInPlace`, which
  `refresh()` calls instead of `drawPanel()`, so the warnings, and each box's text
  (re-read off `/lyric-grid`, `_` for an empty slot), change in the boxes already
  there, the scroll and the focus stay, and the `state` ping the file watcher sends
  after the import's own write cannot redraw it either — and `api_lyrics` claims
  that write (the new `cleaned_fingerprint` saved under `song_lock` before the slow
  health check), so the watcher normally sends none, while the page ignores a
  "score moved" during an import (`lyricImporting`). The hook refuses (and the
  panel is drawn afresh) when the cleaned fingerprint moved some other way. The
  viewer's cleaned-system pictures (One system, which now shows the cleaned system
  with its words under the printed one, and Compare) carry a version per system in
  their URL: an import moves on only the systems whose text changed, plus the ones
  after where that part's box is blank, since a blank box carries the line on
  (`cleanedSystemsChanged`); any other change of fingerprint moves on all of them.
  The server still renders the whole score once and crops (4.6s for Kantajani's 37
  bars); engraving one system alone was refused as not worth cutting slurs and ties
  at the seams. The old picture stays under an "Updating…" note until the new one
  has loaded (`swapSystemImage`, two at a time); a picture that failed is asked for
  again the next time its system is wanted. Blank cells are omitted, so this editor expresses a lyric line starting in
  a system, not an instruction to clear one isolated cell.
- The clean panel's per-system grid mirrors the backend's answer rules: a blank cell
  inherits the staff's previous answer (shown as a faint placeholder) and `-` marks the
  staff silent from there on, clearing the carry — both cleared and never-named slots are
  flagged `unset` and listed in the "will be DROPPED" confirm before cleaning.
- The **Record stage has two renderers**, and defaults to the scrolling one
  (`src/scrollvideo`, see its own section): it draws the video from the score, needs
  no GUI and runs unattended. The old screen recorder (`src/stemmanauha`, MuseScore +
  QuickRecorder, macOS) is still there, one radio button away. Both write
  `media/video/<slug> <part>.<ext>`, which is the whole integration: `_media_list`,
  `create_video.find_merged_outputs` and the YouTube titles all read the part out of
  that name, so **review, upload, retitling and delete do not know which renderer
  ran**. `pipeline.run_scroll_video` is the glue (it passes the slug as
  `build_videos(basename=...)` so the names come out right); `server._run_record`
  branches on `renderer` and records which one it used in `record.renderer`.
  `find_merged_outputs` matches `.mp4` as well as `.mov` for the same reason.
  This pull request proposes that the scrolling render **take one of this host's
  heavy slots while it runs** (`heavy_slot.heavy_slot`, wrapped around
  `pipeline.run_scroll_video` in `_run_record`). A render is minutes of every core
  the machine has, and so is an agent's test suite or a second song rendering — three
  at once is one slow render and two slow suites rather than any of them finishing
  sooner. AgentDeck owns that queue (a small pool of `flock`ed files under
  `/run/user/<uid>`), and its two existing enforcement points both work by classifying
  a command string in a shell the deck controls; the song app is a systemd service and
  has no such shell, so it asks over HTTP instead — `POST /api/heavy-slots`, heartbeat,
  `DELETE` — and the deck never learns what ran. Two things are deliberately backwards
  from an ordinary queue. **A lease has to be renewed**: a `flock` dies with its holder,
  so a killed render cannot strand a slot, but an HTTP lease can and there is only one
  to strand — hence the heartbeat thread, and hence a lease that expires. And
  **failing to get a slot is fail-open, losing one is not**. Unconfigured, unreachable,
  refused, or busy for half an hour all leave the render running unqueued with a line
  in the song's live log saying so: none of them has told us what else is running, and
  somebody is waiting for a practice track. A heartbeat answering **404** has told us —
  the lease is not held, so the cores may already have been promised to somebody else,
  and carrying on is the two-jobs-on-four-cores case the queue exists to prevent. So
  that stops the render (`SlotLost`), the song keeps the reason in `record.error`, and
  the stage does not move to Upload. Stopping a call that lasts minutes needs somewhere
  to stop *at*: `Slot.guard` wraps the render's own `log`/`progress` callbacks, which
  fire about every percent of the encode. `video.render` now kills ffmpeg when the
  frame loop is abandoned, or it would sit forever on a pipe nobody will write to
  again. The preview and the screen recorder are left alone.
  This pull request proposes that the app's **vertical margins start at 0% top and
  5% bottom** rather than 0/0. The renderer's own default stays 0 — there the number
  means "leave the framing alone", and moving it would silently move `scroll_video.py`
  too — so this is a product default, held twice: `server.DEFAULT_TOP_MARGIN_PERCENT`
  / `DEFAULT_BOTTOM_MARGIN_PERCENT` (the record API's fallback and both
  `scroll-preview*` query defaults) and `DEFAULT_TOP_MARGIN` / `DEFAULT_BOTTOM_MARGIN`
  in `static/app.js`, which prefill the panel. The two have to agree or the preview
  frames the music differently from the video. The bottom edge is the one that needs
  the space: the lowest staff's lyrics otherwise sit against the frame. A default only
  fills a setting nobody answered — a song that recorded at 0 keeps 0, and typing 0
  still means 0. `_run_record` now always passes both margins to the renderer instead
  of only when one is non-zero, which was the same call anyway (the renderer's own
  defaults are 0). It also **remembers a chosen margin the way it remembers the BPM**
  — written into `record` when the request arrives, and falling back to what this song
  chose last before the app-wide default. They used to be written only after a render
  succeeded, so framing decided against a render that then failed was gone by the next
  page load. **A successful preview records it too** — nudging a margin and looking at
  the result is how the choice actually gets made, and requiring a render first lost it
  every time. Both paths go through `_remember_record_settings`, which writes only a real change
  and never while a job is running, since the state file is saved whole.
  **The panel's Preview button saves them first** (#301), through `POST /record-settings`,
  which also backs a **Save settings** button: quality, tempo, both margins, shared
  staves and the NVIDIA choice, checked by `_scroll_settings` — the same checks the
  render runs. Before that Preview only opened the tab, where a second button had to be
  found before anything was asked of the server, so nothing was kept and the tab sat
  blank. Opening it from the panel now starts preparing at once, with a moving bar and a
  seconds counter, since the server reports no progress for that step. A framing the
  renderer refuses is not recorded: coming back to a margin that cannot be drawn would
  be a trap. Nothing else about the preview writes to the song — no stage moves, no
  video appears.
- The Record panel already has a **silent scroll preview**, so the layout question can be
  answered before the encoding one. Whether the margins are right, whether the staff
  size reads, where the beat marker sits, whether a repeat lands on the right bar —
  all of that used to cost a full render to find out, and video encoding is the wrong
  feedback loop for it. `GET /scroll-preview` prepares the render's own data
  (`pipeline.scroll_preview` → `src.scrollvideo.preview`) off the worker thread and
  hands it to a player in the page (`static/scroll_preview.js`, `.pvviewport` in the
  stylesheet), with play/pause/restart/scrub. No ffmpeg, no audio, and — apart from
  the framing it was asked for, which this pull request proposes recording (see the
  margin note above) — nothing written into the song's state: it is a look at the
  score, not a stage of the work.
  The prepared payload is cached beside the song under a key naming the cleaned
  score's fingerprint **and** every setting that moves the picture (size, both
  margins, the tempo the app supplies), so a score edited in MuseScore or a margin
  nudged is prepared again rather than reused. Preparing costs seconds, which is why
  it is cached at all.
- The player also has **opt-in synchronized audio**. It stays silent and uses its
  wall clock until the user checks Audio, so opening or playing the picture does
  not generate a WAV. The
  visual preview keeps a private copy of `build.prepare`'s exact render source;
  `GET /scroll-preview-audio` validates the picture's revision and selected `ALL`
  or singing-part mix, then calls `audio.render_mix_cached` in the same
  `media/.scrollvideo-audio` cache the final renderer uses. Opening the picture
  still renders no audio. Once enabled, the browser prepares only the selected mix, uses the
  native audio element's `currentTime` as the picture clock, and falls back to wall
  time only for the renderer's short silent tail after the WAV ends. Switching a
  part keeps the current position, ignores stale requests, and swaps between
  pre-painted focus/background highlight tiles without engraving or rasterising
  again. An audio error leaves the picture and controls available.
- This pull request changes **what the preview is made of: the renderer's own
  pixels**, not its SVG. The preview drew the engraving in the browser, and a browser
  is not what draws the video. Verovio writes lyrics, measure numbers and part names
  as `font-family="Times, serif"`; cairosvg resolves that against the host's fonts
  and a browser against its own, so the words in the preview were never the words in
  the video, and nothing about the layout was quite what would be encoded. So the
  server now rasterises with the same call the renderer makes (`build.raster`, split
  out of `build_videos` the way `build.prepare` already was), only at
  `preview.PREVIEW_HEIGHT` rather than 2160, and sends **two strips as PNG tiles**:
  the engraving, and the same engraving with every playable glyph already repainted
  blue (`preview.lit_strip`, `video.lit_pixels` — the renderer's own arithmetic). A
  frame in the page is a canvas holding a window onto the first strip, a translucent
  band, and a copy of each sounding symbol's box out of the second — the three steps
  `video.render` takes, in that order. The browser therefore no longer decides how
  the music is drawn or what colour a lit note goes; it decides nothing. Tiles
  because Chrome refuses an image past 16384px on a side and a score is wider than
  that. The cache is now a folder (`<song>/.scroll-preview/`, payload plus tiles,
  served by name and emptied before a rebuild, since tile names are positional), and
  preparing costs a rasterisation on top of the engraving: ~15s for two minutes of
  music, ~900 KB of PNG. Still seconds against the render's minutes, and it fixes a
  real disagreement as well as a cosmetic one — a bottom margin revealed the spacer
  rest staff in the preview, which the video deliberately crops to white.
- This pull request proposes moving the preview **out of the Record panel and into
  the viewer**, as a `preview` tab beside the score documents, because on a phone the
  panel is a task screen and the preview is a full-screen visual — the same split the
  rest of the mobile Review/Record redesign makes. The Record panel keeps only the
  controls plus a **Preview** button that opens that tab, and the third mobile tab
  reads **Preview** while in Record rather than Score.
  That move is what makes the preview's **lifecycle** a question at all, and the
  answer is that hiding is not destroying. Switching Preview → Record to nudge a
  margin is the normal move, so `_pausePreview` stops the sound and the frames and
  leaves the prepared picture and the prepared WAV mounted; coming back is instant
  and costs no second rasterisation. Destroying is reserved for the case where the
  preview is *wrong*: the panel keeps a signature of every input that moves the
  picture (quality, both margins, the tempo the app supplies) **plus the cleaned
  score's fingerprint**, and when that signature changes it tears the player down and
  says so. Tearing down takes the sound with it — the audio request is aborted, the
  element cleared and the object URL revoked — because a stale mix heard against a
  new picture is the wrong tempo or the wrong crop, and sounds like neither. Late
  responses cannot undo any of that: a picture that arrives after its signature
  stopped matching is dropped, and a WAV that arrives after its player was destroyed
  is revoked rather than attached.
- The **Fix** panel lists the health issues and the outstanding free-text fixes, and
  this pull request proposes it also **record a missing slur** — see the `fixes.json`
  notes above for why that judgement can only come from a person. Two routes:
  `GET /bar` hands back the singing parts, the bar count and one bar's chords in the
  numbering a recorded fix uses (`pipeline.bar_for_fix`), and `POST /fixes/slur`
  appends the entry and applies it (`pipeline.record_slur_fix`), then claims its own
  write with `_rescan` so the file watcher does not read it as a MuseScore edit and
  re-check a second time. `GET /bar` answers with the choices even when no bar is
  named, because the panel needs the parts before it can ask about a bar and both come
  off one parse. Each note is shown with whether the lyrics land on it today, so the
  panel can say *before* the write that the bar is about to lose a syllable — and it
  warns outright when lyrics are already imported, because that line will come back
  one syllable too long. The cleaned system crop is shown alongside where one is
  available (`/compare` + `/cleaned-system/{index}`); it needs a MuseScore render, so
  not having it costs a picture rather than the feature.
- **The Fix panel offers homr's other readings of an unsure bar** (#269,
  `bar_readings.py`). For each bar homr doubted, homr writes the three likeliest
  readings that fill it (note lengths only) into the fragment's MusicXML
  (`identification/miscellaneous`, field `homr-bar-readings`, eerovil/homr
  `homr/bar_readings.py`). An offer is placed on the cleaned staff whose bar holds those
  notes at those lengths — matched by content, since cleaning renumbers parts, staves and
  voices — and shown under the page crop, each option engraved by verovio. A pick is a
  `rhythm` entry in `fixes.json`, applied in place (a re-clean would lose lyrics), which
  rewrites the lengths, re-brackets the triplets, moves ties and slurs with their notes
  and takes `rhythm?` off the red mark (#290: only what a pick answers comes off — a
  whole-bar pick takes homr's `rhythm?`, `pitch?`, `accidental?`, `notes?`, a pitch pick
  `pitch?` and `accidental?`; `voice?` and cleaning's own marks stay). It carries the fragment's content stamp, and
  `drop_stale_picks` removes it before a clean once that system has been read again
  differently. "None of these" is kept in `.song.json` (`readings.declined`).
- **Every problem is one list, each with its choices** (#290, `problems.py`, `GET
  /problems`, `POST /problems/pick`). The panel used to say one problem up to three
  times — a `fixes.json` sentence, a red-mark health row, the bar again under "Unsure
  bars" — and only the last offered anything to tap. Now a row is one bar of one part:
  everything wrong there, the page crop, and its a/b/c choices. Red marks are read
  **live off the cleaned score**, not off the `clean-marker` sentences, which are only
  rewritten at the next clean and so kept listing marks a person had already deleted;
  a dismissed health row still hides its mark. The choices: homr's lengths (#269);
  homr's other **pitches** for a note whose pitch or accidental it doubted (field
  version 2, key `notes`, eerovil/homr#91), recorded as a `pitch` entry; and for a slur
  cleaning took out because it ran between two singers, the slur back in either, both,
  or none — `cross_voice_slurs` keeps where both halves stood in a `removedSlurs`
  metaTag, a pick is `slur` entries (which may now reach into a later bar) plus
  `unmark` entries for both red marks. A song cleaned before this has no metaTag, so
  its slur marks are listed without choices until it is cleaned again. `voice?`, `notes?` and the other sentences are
  listed with nothing to pick.
  **A repeat with no start is asked about too** (#312, `problems.repeat_questions`): an
  end-repeat sign with no start sign since the previous end, because homr misses a
  start sign that opens a printed system and the track then repeats the wrong bars.
  The choices are the first bar of each printed system in between, as words; a pick
  is a `repeat` entry in `fixes.json` (a start sign on every staff), and **a**, "no
  start sign on the page", is kept in `.song.json` (`repeats.kept`) so it is asked once.
  **So is a repeat with no brackets** (#319, `problems.volta_questions`): homr reads no
  volta brackets at all — on Shakkitarina they stand above the chord names, past the
  room homr keeps above a staff — and a repeat without them looks the same in the
  score, so **every** end repeat with no bracket over it is asked once. The choices are
  "1." over the last 1-4 bars; a pick is a `volta` entry (`score_fixes._add_volta`,
  on the top staff, where MuseScore keeps voltas) and "2." is always one bar, since
  only the "1." length changes what is played. **a**, no brackets, is kept in
  `.song.json` (`voltas.kept`). Kantajani bar 18's "1. kerta / 2. kerta" is not a
  volta — it is two versions of one bar for one voice, printed as text.
  **#295 replaced the separate length and pitch choices with whole bars**, because
  picking them one after the other mixed them up (the pitch options were drawn with
  the old lengths). `bar_readings.whole_bars` pairs every reading of the lengths with
  every pitch for each unsure note, ranks them by homr's log-likelihood plus each
  pitch's log-probability, and offers at most `MOST` (18), `SHOWN` (6) before
  "More". **a** is the bar as read; **b** is homr's **second reading** when there is
  one (field version 3, key `second`: the crop read again at 80% read the bar
  differently — the `notes?` mark), whatever it would rank, since it is what catches a
  mistake the decoder was sure of. homr writes it only where the two readings line up
  voice for voice and both fill the bar. A pick is one `bar` entry
  (`score_fixes._replace_bar`): with the notes in the same places the lengths are
  rewritten as `rhythm` does and the pitches set, keeping ties, slurs and words;
  otherwise the bar is written afresh, ties and slurs reaching in are cut, and the words
  go back on its notes in order. `rhythm` and `pitch` entries already recorded still
  replay, and their bar shows as decided.
  **A bar a recorded fix already wrote is not offered** (#368). An offer lands on
  whichever part holds homr's notes *now*, so on Annin laulu bar 8, after page-checked
  `bar` fixes had un-swapped the basses, homr's B2 line was offered on B1 and picking
  "a" wrote the swap back; the clean then failed on the clash. So a bar a `bar`,
  `pitch`, `rhythm`, `duration`, `undot`, `append`, `drop`, `dropnote` or `addnote`
  entry (or an `unmark` of `notes?`/`rhythm?`/`pitch?`/`accidental?`) has written is
  decided as `{"answered": ...}` and listed as "answered by fixes.json" with the fix's
  `why` (`bar_readings.ANSWERING`, counted in file order past `delbar`/`insbar`). Each
  remaining choice names the bar and part in its title, marks an option that is another
  part's current line ("the line B2 has now — gives it to B1", `line_of`), lists what
  `fixes.json` already does to that bar on this part and the parts printed with it
  (`fixes`), and boxes the bar on the page crop: `GET /system/{n}/where` →
  `system_finder.bar_box`, which finds the staff by its lines and the bar by barlines
  that stand clear of noteheads **and** at the same x on every staff, drawn only when
  their count is the system's bar count (else the whole staff, dashed; nothing when the
  crop shows other staves than the score records). Measured on ten songs' crops, about
  60% of systems get the bar.
- **The score can be taken away and brought back**, which this pull request proposes
  (#216). Both editing routes the app had assumed MuseScore was on *this* host:
  `open-score` shells out to `open -a`, and the file watcher re-checks a score saved
  under `songs/`. From the phone the app is actually used from — or from any other
  computer — neither happens, so the Fix and Review stages could be read and never
  acted on. `GET /score-file` sends the cleaned `.mscx` as a download under its own
  name, and `POST /score-file` puts the fixed one back: `pipeline.accept_uploaded_score`
  parses it first and only then moves it into place, so a refused upload leaves the
  score that is there alone — this is the one route that overwrites the file every
  later stage is derived from. `.mscz` is accepted as well, because that is what
  MuseScore's Save As writes by default. Landing it is deliberately **an edit and not
  a stage**: the route claims its own write with `_rescan` (so the watcher does not
  check the same file twice), the health record is re-taken against what arrived, and
  an approval recorded against the old fingerprint lapses by itself. Nothing is
  replaced while a scan, clean, render or upload is running — that would be read
  half-written — and the panel's confirmation survives its own refresh, or the only
  sign the file arrived would be the health rows quietly changing.
- `omr.py` is added by this pull request: **one call that turns a page image into a
  MusicXML path**, `read_page(image, out_dir=..., log=...)`. It runs homr (optical
  music recognition, adopted in #86), which is the first thing the app depends on that
  cannot live in the app's environment — so where it lives is the decision this module
  carries, and the reasoning is worth keeping.
  homr **is not a pip requirement and must not become one.** It is ~660 MB of
  onnxruntime and opencv wheels, plus ~150 MB of model weights it stores *inside its
  own site-packages*, and `scripts/deploy-song-app.sh --unattended` reinstalls
  `pip-requirements.txt` on every merge — so putting it there would re-download the
  weights on a whim and let a resolution failure in an ML stack take the live app
  down. It also is not the `omr` **distrobox** container it was benchmarked in: that
  container is hand-built host state nothing in this repo describes, which is the cost
  CLAUDE.md's "Working in a worktree" section exists to complain about. And it is not
  a container image either — a build system to hold one venv is not worth the second
  thing to keep working.
  So: a `uv`-managed python 3.12 venv outside the checkout, built by
  **`scripts/install-homr.sh`** (idempotent; `HOMR_VENV` moves it), called as a
  subprocess. A fresh clone runs one script.
  **And the app can run that script itself** (#249, `homr_install.py`): the
  Scan panel's *homr* box (moved there from the Library page by #261, since that is
  where homr is used and where "not installed" is said) shows the installed commit against the fork's `main`
  (`git ls-remote`, cached ten minutes) and an **Install / Update homr** button,
  with the script's log fetched every 2s while it runs. It is still a press and
  never automatic — the deploy does not touch homr, so the day a parse changes is a
  day somebody chose. It runs under one heavy slot, is refused while any song job
  runs (it replaces files inside the venv a scan reads from), and scans and *Ask
  homr* answer 409 while it runs — each read holds a token file taken under the same `flock` as the install, so neither can start in the gap after the other's check, even across the old and new server during a restart; a pid lock file beside the songs keeps it to one
  at a time. The button always installs `main` (an explicit `HOMR_SOURCE` is a
  shell's business), and the script now fetches `uv` into `~/.local/bin` when a
  host has none, which was the one step that stopped a fresh install cold.
  **Where homr comes from is one variable in that script, `HOMR_SOURCE`.** It defaulted
  to the immutable `eerovil/homr` commit matching upstream `v0.7.0`; this pull request
  moves it to **`@main`**, the fork's tip, which today is upstream's own tip. An
  explicit `HOMR_SOURCE` still wins, and a commit hash is how an old parse is got back.
  #97 put multi-page joining, the staff-grouping fix and PDF input *inside the fork*,
  because the app only ever sees homr's output and by then the staves are gone; all
  three later landed upstream too, and `choir-0.7.0` is exactly the v0.7.0 tag. The
  fork **carrying nothing of its own** was true for about a month and is not true now:
  it is a couple of hundred commits ahead of `liebharc/homr` — general OMR fixes, choir
  fixtures, and the measurement harness — and it is not going back, since the harness
  alone is a large share of that and belongs there. Since #220 it is **level with
  upstream `main`** at each sync: everything upstream has is merged in (see "Where an OMR
  fix belongs" above, which also says which side of the line a new fix falls on).
  The app passes homr **`--no-title`**: it never uses the title homr reads, and since
  upstream's 9ec3a78 reading one means fetching OCR weights first.
  It also passes **`--mark-doubt`** (#245), to a homr whose source has it
  (`engine_supports`): homr reads each image a second time, at 80% size, and puts a
  red `⚠` text on every bar it is probably wrong about — a near-tie between two
  readings that both fill the bar, an unsure pitch, accidental or voice line, two
  voices giving one shared notehead different lengths, the second reading
  disagreeing, or a note starting off every sixteenth and triplet sixteenth
  (`homr/doubt.py` in the fork). The owner asked that **no wrong bar go unmarked**,
  false alarms second: measured on 38 systems read in the cluster pod, all 9 wrong
  bars with owner-checked references are marked (with 39 of 117 right ones — most of
  Legenda, where homr really is unsure of nearly every triplet), and 26 of 27 on four
  songs whose references are less certain. Confidence alone could not do it: some
  readings are wrong with the decoder sure of every note, and the second reading is
  what catches those. A read takes twice as long. The marks are the same as
  cleaning's (`problem_marks`), so they survive the clean on the first part the
  staff becomes, are listed by health and the Fix panel until deleted, and never
  reach the video. A homr too old to mark says so in the scan log, because no marks
  then means "not checked".
  What following a branch costs is worth saying rather than skipping: an install is no
  longer reproducible from the checkout alone, so two hosts set up a month apart get
  different OMR and so does one host reinstalled. What buys it back is that **nothing
  installs homr automatically** — it is not in `pip-requirements.txt` and the deploy
  never touches its venv — so the day the parse changes is a day somebody ran the
  script, and running it is when the frozen benchmark should be run again. Nothing in
  `omr.py` or in the rest of the installer moves with it.
  **A branch of the fork is not installed at all.** That install is the one homr
  install there is; a branch is run from a **local working copy**, and this is the
  shape that pull request settled on after trying a venv per branch. The only
  question a homr branch exists to answer is whether it reads *this* repertoire
  better than what we already have, and answering it means editing, re-reading a
  page, editing again — a 660 MB reinstall between passes is not a loop anybody
  uses. So the checkout at `HOMR_CHECKOUT` (default `~/homr`) **and every git
  worktree beside it** are engines: the dependencies come from the installed venv
  and the code comes from the working copy, put in front of it on `PYTHONPATH`
  (`<venv>/bin/python -c "from homr.main import main; main()"` — the package has no
  `__main__`, and the venv's own `bin/homr` would import the installed copy whatever
  `PYTHONPATH` said). Switching a branch there changes what the next
  scan runs, with nothing to rebuild and nothing to keep in step. The label is the
  branch, **read live from git** rather than remembered, because that is the whole
  point; the price is that such an engine is whatever is checked out at the moment it
  runs, which is why the installed venv stays as the fixed thing to compare against.
  **Both labels name what they actually are**, which took a second pass to get right.
  A checkout is `<branch> — <directory>`: neither half identifies it alone, since a
  worktree keeps its directory name when its branch changes (a tree called `system-4`
  is on `main` on this host) and two trees can be on branches that read alike. The
  installed one is `installed: <revision> @ <commit>`, read out of pip's own
  `direct_url.json` — it said `main` before, which was a guess this venv could not
  support: it predates `homr-engine.txt`, so the label would have read `main` whatever
  commit was installed, and "the frozen one" is worth nothing if it cannot say what it
  is frozen at. The marker file and an explicit `HOMR_SOURCE` are the fallbacks behind
  it.
  One thing this costs and pays for: homr keeps its ~150 MB of weights **beside its
  own source**, so a working copy run this way would download its own set — per
  worktree, four times over here. `link_weights` symlinks the installed venv's
  `.onnx` files into a checkout the first time it is picked. Safe because the file
  names carry a content hash: a branch wanting different weights asks for a different
  name and downloads it. Only missing files are linked and a real file is never
  replaced.
  `omr.engines()` lists what this host can run — the installed one first, then the
  working copies — and `engine_for(key)` resolves a choice, **refusing an engine that
  is not there** rather than falling back to the default: a parse nobody can account
  for is worse than a refused request. `read_page(engine=...)` is the whole of the
  rest (an `Engine` carries its argv and the environment it needs), threaded through
  `omr_systems.read_system` and `scan.run`.
  The choice is **per scan run**, and comparing two engines is reading a system with one
  and then the other — the retry button that already exists — and looking at both against
  the page. It used not to be recorded anywhere; this pull request proposes that **every
  parse says which homr produced it** (#154, #157), and the reasoning is under `scan.py`
  below. `read_page` writes it: one comment line before the root element, carrying the
  engine key, the label, the **commit** and whether the working copy was **dirty**.
  `Engine` carries the last two — pip's `direct_url.json` for the installed venv, `git
  rev-parse` and `git status --porcelain` for a working copy, both read at the moment the
  engine is listed, the same way the branch already is. The commit is the record and the
  label is the hint: `main` in a working copy means a different commit next week. The line
  is inserted and removed **textually** (`strip_provenance`), so taking it off gives back
  the bytes homr wrote — which is what lets `scan.content_stamp` step over it, and is
  therefore what keeps this provenance rather than a fourth stamp.
  `GET /api/homr-engines` is app-wide, because which homr a host
  has is a property of the host; the Scan panel's **Read with** picker appears only
  when there is more than one, and the scan route resolves the key at the door so a
  missing engine is a 400 rather than a run that takes the lock and dies on band one.
  Two things the earlier notes got wrong and one that has since changed under us.
  homr declares `>=3.11,<3.16` and installs on 3.14 too, so the version is a choice and
  not a wall — 3.12 because every benchmark number in #93 and #95 came off 3.12. There
  was **no `[cpu]` extra** on 0.7.0, so upstream's `uvx --from 'homr[cpu]' homr` recipe
  silently ignored it and the plain install pulled CPU onnxruntime. On `main` that is
  reversed and the extra is **load-bearing**: onnxruntime has moved out of the base
  dependencies into `cpu`/`cuda`/`rocm`, so a plain install of `main` has no inference
  runtime at all and fails at the first parse rather than at install time. `HOMR_SOURCE`
  therefore names `homr[cpu] @ git+...`. CPU is still the only one this host can use.
  What the module absorbs is the CLI's shape. homr takes one image, writes
  `<image>.musicxml` **beside it**, has no `--output`, and drops a `_teaser.png` next
  to the input, so the run happens on a copy in a scratch dir and only the answer is
  moved to where the caller asked. `--gpu` is passed **`no`** every time and never
  left at `auto`: auto asks whether the CUDA provider is *registered*, not whether it
  can run, and this host's GTX 970 is sm_52 against onnxruntime's sm_60 floor, so auto
  would pick CUDA and die on the first segnet node without falling back (#93). Note
  the value is `no`, not `off`. Output is streamed line by line to a `log` callback —
  a page is ~30s and a song 2–5 minutes, so that is the progress channel #93 asked
  for — and every failure raises `HomrError` carrying the tail of what homr said.
  Including the quiet one: homr **deletes its own MusicXML when parsing raises**, so a
  zero exit with no file is a failure and is reported as one. The deadline is a timer
  that kills the process group, not `wait(timeout=...)`, because reading the pipe is
  what blocks. Not installed is its own error (`HomrMissing`) naming the install
  script.
  **A page is read under one of this host's heavy slots**, through the same
  `heavy_slot` client the scrolling render uses — not a second slot client. A page is
  ~30s of every core on a four-core host shared with the deck's own suites and a song
  rendering, which is exactly what that queue is for. Its two backwards-looking rules
  carry over unchanged and are not re-argued here: **failing** to get a slot is
  fail-open (the scan runs unqueued with a line in the log), **losing** one is not (a
  heartbeat answering 404 means the cores may already be somebody else's, so the page
  stops with `SlotLost`). homr's own output lines are the checkpoints `Slot.guard`
  needs, and abandoning the read loop kills homr's process group — otherwise it would
  keep running on cores that have been handed away.
  **One slot per page, not one per song.** The page is the unit `read_page` owns and
  each page writes its own MusicXML, so releasing between pages lets a render or a
  suite in, and an interruption costs the page in flight rather than the song — the
  pages already read are on disk. A caller that would rather hold one lease across a
  whole song passes `queue=False` and wraps the loop itself, so the two never nest
  (nesting would deadlock a one-slot pool).
  **Slur pairing used to happen here and is homr's now** (#144: eerovil/homr#62's
  `homr/slur_resolution.py`; the app copy was removed once the fork was installed and the
  old pass dropped nothing on its output). What follows is why it exists, kept because
  the reasoning is the fork's justification too. It was `resolve_slurs`, added for #113. homr predicts
  `slurStart` / `slurStop` one note at a time and never pairs them, and the MusicXML
  `number` that pairing depends on is the *staff* number — the same for every slur on
  the staff. So a dropped stop does not merely lose its own slur: it leaves the start
  open to be closed by whatever stop comes next. On B5's whole page that produces two
  slurs nobody engraved, one of 5¼ bars and one of 3, covering 21 notes; a slur
  continuation takes no syllable, so the page offers **91 lyric slots for 132 notes**.
  Sixteen swallowed. The direction is the trap: it reads as `too_few`, which the
  playbook below teaches a reader to attribute to a voice sharing another staff's
  words. So `read_page` pairs the tokens the way MuseScore does and keeps only pairs at
  most **one barline** apart (`MAX_SLUR_BARS`, env `OMR_MAX_SLUR_BARS`). That threshold
  is measured, not assumed: across all seven benchmark parses every pair is nought or
  one bar apart except those two runaways, the human-corrected `Lemmen nosto` has no
  longer slur in the 68 bars of the page they come from, and one barline is what a
  genuine melisma crosses (`il-man il-ki-rii-vi-`). It is a claim about *this input*,
  not about engraving — real scores in `songs/` do print four-bar phrase marks, but
  homr has no way to write one deliberately.
  **This is the boundary and not the assembler**, which is where #113 first put it. The
  `number` the mis-pairing turns on is the staff number, so nothing about the defect is
  per-page or per-crop: a whole-page parse has it and so does one system cut out of the
  same page. Normalising it here means every parse gets it however it was cropped, and
  it does not go down with #103 if that card is thrown away.
  **The unmatched tokens go as well, and that is the part that cost the most to find.**
  #112 measured a lone dangler as cosmetic, and in isolation it is — MuseScore drops it.
  In a stream it is not: an unmatched stop loses *every later slur of that number*, and
  a redundant start is merely promoted when the runaway in front of it is removed, so it
  closes on a stop further away still. Measured on B5: dropping the runaway pairs alone
  left a fresh 2-bar runaway at m51, taking out the redundant starts alone took the page
  from 21 slurs to 6, and doing all of it in one pass gives 24, none over a bar — five
  of them short slurs homr got right that the noise had been costing it. What is written
  back is one alternating stream, so the score and the pairing cannot drift apart, and
  running it again finds nothing. A parse with nothing to change is left byte for byte
  as homr wrote it.
  **Every parse also comes back with its whole-measure rests in a voice of their own**
  (`split_measure_rests`, proposed by this pull request for #164, off #130's
  measurement). homr's token language has no way to say "second voice on this staff" —
  no voice token, no voice field on its symbol record, and `upper`/`lower` meaning
  *staff* rather than voice, which upstream state themselves in liebharc/homr#126. So a
  printed whole-bar rest and the notes of the voice engraved beside it come out sharing
  one `<voice>` with no `<backup>` between them, and the bar overfills by a whole note
  automatically. The bar this was found on is 4/4 and came out **seven quarters long**.
  Nothing downstream catches it: `preprocess_corrupted_measures` declines, and
  `fix_overfull_measures` correctly refuses a voice that ends on a note — so it reaches
  the cleaned score as `len="28/16"`, and every *other* staff's measure rest in that bar
  is then the wrong length, which no health check sees and which surfaces only as a
  scrolling video the renderer refuses.
  The rule is one sentence: **a rest written `type="whole"` that shares a `<voice>` with
  any other note or rest cannot be that voice's, because a whole-measure rest alone fills
  the bar.** Nothing is invented and nothing is deleted — one voice number changes and
  the measure's cursor arithmetic is redone around it, which is what makes the bar
  shorter; relabelling the `<voice>` alone would leave it exactly as long as it was. It
  needs **no meter**, and that is what makes it a boundary repair rather than
  `clean_score`'s: a per-system crop usually declares no time signature at all, so a rule
  that had to know the bar length could not run here.
  **It is narrow, and measured.** All 41 whole rests across the seven benchmark parses
  and the fixture's nine crops carry a full whole note whatever the meter; the rule fires
  on **two** of them, the two that share a voice. The other 39 rest alone in their voice,
  make no musical claim, and `fix_overfull_measures` already re-lengths them to the real
  bar. End to end on the fixture's nine systems, health goes **24 findings to 22** — the
  two `unprinted-meter` rows on that bar, and nothing else moves.
  **What it deliberately does not fix**, and why the record below is not optional: the
  voice the rest was sharing is left however homr read it, which on that bar is three
  quarters of music in a bar of four, because a quarter rest was lost as well. A *short*
  bar is a better failure than a bar seven quarters long — the missing note surfaces as
  lyric syllable overflow at import, while the long bar silently drags the practice track
  — and inventing it back is what `fix_overfull_measures` refuses to do. But cleaning
  then pads that hole and health goes quiet, so a loudly wrong bar becomes a quietly
  wrong one, which is this project's named failure mode occurring inside a repair. Hence
  `read_page`'s `repairs` argument: a caller that has to tell somebody passes a list, and
  `scan.py` writes what comes back into the song's `fixes.json` (below). A log line is
  not a record. The dotted eighth that bar also lost is **not** fixable in principle — a
  dot rides inside a single rhythm token, so there is nothing to recover — and the
  `rest_0` token bug behind the four-quarter whole rest is homr's under the #141 rule,
  opportunistic to upstream and blocking nothing.
  Deliberately **not** here yet, because they belong to other cards on #92's map:
  pages are not stitched into one score (#97), and the deploy and `/healthz` do not
  know homr exists. `read_page` is called now — by `scan.py`, one band at a time.
- `omr_systems.py` is added by this pull request, and it settles what the unit of work
  is: **one printed system, not one page.** Given a page, homr builds a part by taking
  staff index N out of *every* system it found, which assumes the score is a rectangle
  — the same staves, in the same order, in every system. Choral engraving is not a
  rectangle: a part that rests through a system is simply not printed, so a page really
  can be 2-3-2-3-3 staves. When the counts disagree homr deletes an edge system and,
  failing that, breaks every group into singletons, which is how B5 — four vocal staves
  — came out of a whole-page scan as one monophonic line of 70 bars. Given **one**
  system there is nothing to reconcile and the assumption becomes vacuous rather than
  wrong. That is why #105 was closed without a fork change: the defect does not occur
  on this input.
  Three calls, and the middle one is the idea. `read_systems` crops each band
  (`pdf_systems.crop_systems`) and reads it with `omr.read_page`, **one heavy slot per
  system** — the per-page lease taken one step further, which is if anything better:
  shorter holds, so a render or a test suite waiting behind it waits less, and an
  interruption costs the band in flight rather than the page. `flatten` reads a
  system's MusicXML as an ordered list of **staves**, splitting a part on the `<staff>`
  its notes carry, so a fused two-staff "Piano" contributes two exactly where a pair of
  "Voice" parts would. **`part-name` is never read** — homr says "Voice" and "Piano"
  and means neither, and since the notes of a fused part are fully separable,
  grand-staff fusion is a labelling detail with no information loss *in flattening*. homr
  itself fuses braced staves before decoding, though, and on a crowded bar the fused pass
  can drop noteheads: before blaming the model for a lost note, re-read the band one staff
  at a time and check `--output-confidence`. `assemble` writes
  the systems out as one score, one part per staff column.
  **Repeat signs and volta brackets are the whole system's** (#312,
  `_system_barlines`): one staff reading one is written on every staff of that system,
  a left barline ahead of the bar's notes. homr reads a start sign at the head of a
  system on some staves and not others, and MuseScore 3 keeps a start repeat only
  when every part carries it — Kantajani bar 27, read on two staves of four, came out
  of the conversion with no repeat at all.
  **What flattening must not do is move the notes, and until this pull request it did**
  (#172). Splitting a part on its `<staff>` means the `<backup>` and `<forward>` homr
  wrote cannot be kept as they stand — they step between staves as well as between
  voices, and the other staves are about to go — so they were dropped and every voice was
  re-laid from the head of the bar. But that is exactly *how homr says when a note
  sounds*: a voice it wrote later in the bar slid to beat one, and the phrase under it
  came with it. Issue #166 measured it while answering a different question and it is the
  largest single loss that map found: **73.5% of the notes right where homr's own reading
  of the same crop scored 92.3%**, 43 of 61 systems losing notes, one going 100% to 0.0%.
  For scale, the per-system seam that card spent a corpus run measuring costs 1.2 points.
  So the bar is now **read by following homr's cursor** — a note moves it on, a `backup`
  winds it back, a `forward` moves it on — which gives every note the beat homr put it on,
  and the staff is written back out voice by voice with the steps that put each note back
  there. The two things the rebuild existed for survive: voices are still renumbered from
  1 (a voice number means nothing outside its part, and this staff is becoming one), and
  the two staves of a fused part still each start at the head of the bar — but now because
  the backup between them says so, rather than because everything was reset. A chord note
  is the one case that takes no step, since it sounds *with* the note before it rather
  than after it. `scripts/flatten_vs_reference.py` is the measurement, committed by this
  pull request because #166's own harness did not survive that session.
  **Which voice a note comes out on is decided once for the staff, and this pull request
  proposes that** (#187). Renumbering from 1 is still necessary and still done, but it
  used to be done again in every bar, from the order the notes were *written* in — which
  is homr's interleaving and not a fact about the music. Two singers therefore swapped
  places whenever homr happened to write the lower one first, and a bar where only one of
  them sang compacted whichever singer that was down to voice 1 and handed the part back
  afterwards. Every note was present, at the right pitch, on the right beat, in the wrong
  part: **no health check sees that** — both voices are well-formed and the bar adds up —
  and a singer meets it as somebody else's line in their practice track, which is #148's
  second-worst error kind in its most confusing form. #173 measured it on Kaksi laulua
  krapulasta p4 — three staves in all five systems — as **62.9% assembled against a
  flattened 99.7%, with 119 voice faults and zero pitch, size or timing faults**. Now the
  staff's voices are numbered once, in the order of **homr's own numbers**, and that page
  assembles at **99.7% with one voice fault**.
  **Every number in this paragraph was re-measured for #192 on the homr this host runs**,
  `main @ 6c3bbf4`, because #187's came off band parses read by `b1c9203` and the engine
  has moved since. Same corpus — #173's 63 bands over 14 pages of Herää Suomi, Kaksi
  laulua krapulasta 2 and Käyttäytymisohjeita — re-read at 200 dpi and scored by the
  fork's own `compare_output` at the same commit as the engine. Read as homr writes them
  the bands score **92.5%** (`b1c9203`: 90.3%); flattening's own cost is **0.4 points**
  and it adds **no** voice faults (49 before, 49 after); and the fourteen assembled pages
  go **62.2% with 257 voice faults** under the old per-bar rule to **69.1% with 40** under
  this one. So what #187 claimed still holds, and the engine's own reading of these bands
  has improved slightly rather than drifted. **These are #196's settled digits, not #192's**
  — that card scored them with a comparator that ranked a staff's voices off the first
  moment either was seen, which one invented and never-scored note can reverse (see the
  retraction below), and it published 91.1% / 93 on the bands and 68.2% / 67 assembled.
  #196 replaced the rule and re-scored the same cached parses, reproducing #192's figures
  exactly with the old rule first, so what moved is the scorer and not the run. Two figures
  above are **not** #196's and are marked as such wherever they are used: the `b1c9203`
  90.3% and the old per-bar rule's 62.2% / 257 both pre-date it and were not re-scored, so
  read those two gaps as large rather than as exactly 2.2 and 6.9 points.
  One trap is worth recording because it nearly produced a fake regression. `86d0f2a`
  (#153) writes a head drawn with two stems into **both** voices, as the page prints it,
  and the `b1c9203` scorer collapses a unison on the reference side only — so every
  recovered unison reads as "a different number of notes here". Scored that way today's
  parses come out 9.3 points *worse* with 49 of 63 systems apparently regressing and not
  one improving, which is the shape that gave it away. **Re-measuring an engine means
  moving the scorer with it.**
  **Ordering by which voice sounds higher was measured and refused, and nothing since has
  given a reason to reach for it.** It is the tempting rule — MusicXML's convention is that
  voice 1 is the upper line — and on `b1c9203`'s parses it scored about the same overall
  (68.7% against 68.3%). Re-measured for #192 it scores **67.7% with 84 voice faults against
  68.2% with 67**, and the only page it changes at all is Herää Suomi p3, where the two
  basses cross on the page and ranking by height swaps a column homr had numbered right —
  **95.8% and 3 voice faults down to 85.6% and 20**. Those four figures were scored by the
  comparator **#196 has since replaced** and were not re-derived, so read the p3 swap as
  large rather than as exactly 10.2 points. Both sides of each pair come off one rule, which
  makes them a fair comparison **under that rule**; it does not make the gap invariant under
  #196's, since a new ranking can move the two sides by different amounts, and that has not
  been measured. What does not move with them
  is the crossing-voices argument, which is a fact about p3's engraving and not about any
  score: where two voices cross, "voice 1 is the upper line" is false of the page itself.
  Homr's own numbering is also the better claim where the two disagree, putting the higher
  voice first in **341 of the 357 corpus bars carrying two against 316** for the order the
  notes happen to be written in.
  **#196 reached the same refusal from its own side of the fence, and that is corroboration
  rather than the same measurement.** Its question was which rule the *harness* should rank
  a staff's voices by — a different rule in a different program, see the two paragraphs
  below — and it measured mean height at **92.3% with 55 voice faults on the bands and
  69.1% with 40 assembled**, against **92.5% / 49 and 69.1% / 40** for counting which voice
  is the higher line in more of the staff's bars. It shipped the bar count, and what decided
  it was `heraa-suomi-final-s10`, where the two basses cross and the reference's own two
  voices sit **0.1 of a step apart** in mean height over 12 notes against 3: a mean picks a
  winner on nothing there and reports 6 voice faults on a system read note for note
  correctly. So crossing voices defeat a height rule on both sides of the boundary, for the
  same reason, on figures that are now settled rather than disputed.
  **Herää Suomi p1 is not evidence of anything, and this is a retraction** (#190, and the
  claim #194 merged here). Both this file and the two docstrings used to say that homr
  numbers that page's two upper voices one way round in systems 1 and 3 and the other way
  round in 2 and 4, at a cost of **30 voice faults** the assembler could not honestly fix.
  It is not so. Each of the four crops agrees with its own reference — **0, 0, 1 and 0**
  voice faults, system 4 note-for-note perfect — homr numbers voice 1 the higher line in all
  four, and the bars the page-level score faults are correct on both sides, printed out note
  for note. The 30 are the harness's: `fixturecheck.compare._voice_rank` ranks a staff's
  voices by which is **seen first**, and the first moment of staff 1 on that page is one note
  homr wrote a quarter early into voice 2 — a moment the reference does not have, so the
  comparison never scores it while it reverses the ranking of every bar that is scored.
  Replacing that one rule takes the page **44.5% to 70.9%** and its
  voice faults **30 to 1**, which is the same 1 #192 reached by swapping two systems' voices
  and reached by accident. **#196 is the fix and it has landed** (`eerovil/homr#37`, merged
  2026-09-06): the harness now ranks a staff's voices by which is the higher line in more of
  its bars, so p1 stands at **70.9% with 1 voice fault** and the corpus totals above are
  #196's rather than #192's. Mean height reaches the same p1 figure and was measured
  alongside it; the bar count won for the reason given two paragraphs up.
  **What is real there is small and is homr's**: in bar 1 voice 2 enters a quarter early,
  where the page prints the two in unison entering on beat 2. That is a rhythm misread, so
  under the #141 rule it is the fork's — its cost as a note error is one row, and its cost
  as a measurement error was the other 29.
  **None of this weakens #187's refusal to sort the assembler by height; it sharpens it.**
  The two rules are not the same rule and must not be run together in the prose. The
  *harness* needs a **whole-staff** rule, because it has to line one file's voices up against
  another's and first-seen is not a property of the music; #196 shipped counting bars, having
  refused mean height for the crossing-voices reason the assembler refuses it for. The
  *assembler* must not use a height rule at all,
  because ranking by height is a claim — that voice 1 is the upper line — which p3 shows is
  false wherever two voices cross, and because the assembler's job is to stop scrambling
  what homr already said rather than to say something of its own.
  **And voice assignment is no longer the largest remaining boundary-layer loss** (#192).
  It was, when #187 was written; it is now the smallest of the four fault kinds the harness
  counts. The corpus loses 23.4 points between a band as homr wrote it and the assembled
  page — 92.5% to 69.1% — and **0.4 of that is flattening**. All the rest is one thing, and
  it splits by page shape. Over the 10 pages every system of which prints the same number
  of staves, assembly costs **about nothing**: 91.9% per-system, 91.3% assembled, 18 voice
  faults. Over the 4
  where the staff count varies between systems it costs **65 points** — 93.5% to 28.1% —
  and 592 of those faults are `size`, against 22 voice. These are #196's settled figures,
  and the split #192 argued from survives its re-scoring intact: what the old ranking bug
  moved was the voice count, which is the small side of it either way.
  **That 65 points is what an unanswered file scores, and #195 measured how much of it is
  the file rather than the answer.** The harness scores `scanned.musicxml`, which is a
  positional intermediate — `_fill_column` fills a short system's staves from the top and
  says so, and naming the rows is the `--per-system` grid's job, which the harness does not
  run. So this pull request proposes reporting the same four pages with the grid **answered**
  the way an operator would, from the reviewed score's own per-band grouping: cleaned in
  per-system mode and imploded back to the page's printed shape, the pipeline the reference
  itself came out of. Same parses, same scorer, same references.
  `scripts/answered_vs_reference.py` is that measurement, committed for the same reason
  `scripts/flatten_vs_reference.py` was: it re-scores parses somebody else already made, so
  it needs no homr and the claim below can be checked rather than taken.
  **And the answer it was made with is frozen** (`fixtures/answered-pages.json`,
  `scripts/answered_pages.py`), which is the difference between a committed script and
  committed evidence. The grid answer used to be read live — the bands out of
  `.systems.json`, the grouping out of the reviewed cleaned score — and both are host state
  that has moved under earlier measurements on this map already, so the same script on the
  same cached parses could later answer a different question and print a number with nothing
  saying the question had changed. The manifest records each band's index, its printed bar
  range and the staves the grid was answered with, and the scoring path reads that and never
  a song. A page nobody froze is refused rather than read off the host, and a song that has
  moved under a frozen page **stops the run** naming the band and both readings; `--record`
  is the one way to write it and says what it changed.
  `src/clean_score/tests/test_answered_pages.py` pins the refusals — a grouping edited
  underneath a frozen run, a band dragged, a band inserted, a page never frozen — and that
  the grid handed to the rebuild comes off the manifest. It needs no songs, no homr and no
  MuseScore.

  | 4 varying pages | per-system | assembled | assembled, grid answered |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | | 93.5% | 28.3% | **77.2%** |
  | `size` faults | | 592 | **127** |

  Answering the grid returns **48.9 of the 65 points**, and the control says the pipeline is
  not what did it: over the 10 uniform pages the same round trip costs **1.0 point**
  (89.8% → 88.8%), so it neither flatters nor punishes. Corpus-wide, the fourteen pages read
  **84.4%** answered against 68.2% unanswered.

  **And the 16.3 points left are not row placement at all.** They are on two pages, and both
  are one thing: a crop that read **one bar more than the page prints** — Kaksi laulua
  krapulasta 2 p2 s9 and p3 s12 each read 5 bars of a 4-bar system, the only two bar-count
  disagreements in the corpus — after which the assembled score's bar numbers and the page's
  part company and every later bar is compared against its neighbour. Scored up to that
  point those pages are **95.5%** and **97.9%**, against per-system 96.0% and 98.3%: with the
  grid answered, assembly costs **nothing**. The other two varying pages, which have no extra
  bar, come back at 84.4% and 92.3% against per-system 86.3% and 94.4%. Under the #141 rule
  the extra bar is homr's — the parse disagrees with the page — but nothing in the app
  notices it, though `pdf_systems.label` already knows each band's printed bar range and
  `read_systems` could compare the two.
  **So `_fill_column` is not losing music, and it should not start guessing.** The tempting
  fix is to work out which voice went silent from the clef, the part's range across the join,
  or the row it held in the neighbouring systems. It would not help, because a short system
  is usually not a silent voice: of the 9 narrow systems on these four pages, **2** are a
  voice resting (Kaksi laulua p2 s8 and p3 s11, both tenors) and **7** are divisi printed on
  two staves in one system and combined onto one in the others — Käyttäytymisohjeita prints
  T1 and T2 apart in exactly one system of each page and together in the rest. There the
  narrow system's first staff carries *two* of the reference's rows, so no assignment of it
  to a single row is right, and no evidence in the pixels changes that. The judgement is
  which parts a staff carries, not which row it sits on, and the grid already asks for it.
  What the numbers above do settle is that **every assembled figure this map has quoted is a
  number about an unanswered file**, including the corpus 69.1% above.
  **Every figure in this #195 paragraph and its table was scored by the comparator #196 has
  since replaced, and none of them has been re-scored — the differences included.** They are
  quoted here as #195 measured them, so the two columns of the table are like for like and
  the 28.3% in it is #195's own rather than the 28.1% the paragraph above now carries.
  **The gaps are not exempt from that, and an earlier version of this paragraph said they
  were.** It argued that #196 could move the *level* of a score but not the *difference*
  between two scores made with one comparator. That does not follow: replacing the ranking
  rule can move the answered and the unanswered score by **different** amounts, in which
  case the gap between them moves too. Both sides sharing a comparator makes the 48.9 points
  the grid returns, the 1.0 point the round trip costs, and the 84.4% against 68.2%
  corpus-wide honest **historical** measurements under the superseded rule; it does not make
  them invariant under the new one, and nobody has checked. Herää Suomi p1 shows why the
  intuition is tempting and not why it is safe: its 30 spurious voice faults sat in the
  uniform control on both sides and cost that page 0.9 points either way — one page where the
  error happened to cancel, which is an example rather than a proof.
  So the qualitative finding — that answering the grid returns most of the 65 points, and
  that the pipeline round trip is not what did it — is **plausible and unverified**, which is
  why what is claimed above is that most of the 65 comes back rather than that the answered
  corpus is exactly 84.4%. Settling it takes one measurement and no argument: re-score #195's
  cached answered and unanswered outputs with #196's shipped rule and publish the new pair.
  That needs the fork's harness inside homr's venv and is not on this map yet.
  **Which voice is absent from a short system is not decided here**, because it is not
  recoverable from pixels — you need the words, the range, or the piece. Columns are
  filled from the top and the empty rows are measure rests; naming them is
  `clean_score`'s `--per-system` grid's job, and that grid already asks a person.
  Assembly closes the seams that exist only because each crop is its own document: one
  `divisions` for the score with every duration rescaled to it, continuous bar numbers
  instead of bar 1 five times over, a key or time signature written only where it says
  something that was not already true, and a `<print new-system="yes"/>` at each join so
  the grid cuts the score where the page is cut.
  **A slur or tie over a line break is joined here** (#318). Each crop is read alone, so
  homr writes it as a start in the system's last two bars and a stop in the next one's
  first bar, and keeps exactly those loose ends (eerovil/homr, `resolve_slurs`,
  `EDGE_BARS`; this module's `EDGE_BARS` must agree). `_join_slurs` pairs them within
  one staff column when both systems print the same number of staves: last note to
  first note at the same written pitch first, as a tie, then the rest in reading order.
  homr writes one arc mark per note, so a slur and a tie both ending on the next
  system's first note come back as two starts and one stop; the slur is given the
  tie's stop note and marked `⚠ slur?`, since that stop was inferred. A half with no
  partner is marked `⚠ slur?` -- never dropped on a guess that it was a tie, since the
  same pitch across the break may be another staff's; only a half on a note already
  tied that way goes quietly. Measured on the six songs of #274 (71 systems): 13
  slurs and 23 ties restored over breaks, 28 marks.
  **The meter is decided here, and this pull request proposes that** (#177). homr has no
  token for a numerator — its vocabulary holds only `timeSignature/<denominator>` — so the
  number of beats does not exist in what the model can emit and is inferred afterwards
  from how long its own decoded bars came out, one crop at a time. #174 measured what
  that costs and what it does not: forcing the correct meter into a re-read of the Virta
  venhettä vie m11–m14 crop moved `<beats>` and left every other byte of the MusicXML
  identical, so **the notes are already right and the label is the only thing wrong**.
  That is also why the correction lands here rather than in the fork under the #141 rule:
  what is missing is not a misreading but information the crop does not contain, created
  by a seam that is ours (#103). A crop holding 2/4, 2/4, 4/4, 4/4 has no median that is
  right about any of it, and `assemble` is the one place that sees the bars either side
  of a join and every staff at once.
  So `_meter_plan` takes the **numerator from the length of the bars each signature
  governs**, keeps the denominator homr actually read, and carries the meter across a
  seam rather than restating the crop's own fresh guess. It corrects a signature printed
  *inside* a crop too, because the number is inferred wherever it stands — m13's printed
  4/4 came back 3/4 — while a meter change the page really prints (B4's last system goes
  3/4, 5/4, 4/4) stays exactly where it is, and a resting column's measure rest is
  written to the reconciled length rather than to the crop's label.
  **What it refuses to do is as much the point.** A span needs `_MIN_BARS` (2) **bars**
  and a strict majority among them before it may overrule a declared number, so one voice
  short of a note cannot rewrite the meter around its own mistake — the bar stays one that
  contradicts its signature, which is what the health check reports. Bars and not staff
  copies of a bar: two staves of one bar are one reading, so counting them separately
  would reach the threshold inside a single bar and a duration misread the same way on
  both staves would carry it. For the same reason a bar whose staves disagree about its
  length is no observation at all. A whole-measure rest is not one either (homr writes one
  a whole note long whatever the meter, so counting it would drag every span with a
  resting staff towards 4/4), and a length no whole numerator fits is left with the
  signature it was given.
  **One bar is enough against a signature that only restates the meter already in force**,
  and that exception is what keeps the correction working at all. homr writes a signature
  at the head of every crop and again wherever its own decoding wobbled, and "the same as
  before" is not a reading of the page — Virta's m13 prints 4/4 and the crop restated the
  2/4 in force, over a bar both staves read as four quarters. A *change*, and the score's
  opening declaration, both still need two bars, so a one-bar meter change the page really
  prints survives being measured against the single bar it governs. Under the flat
  two-bar rule the fixture keeps its m13 fault and health reads 33 rather than 31.
  Measured on the fixture with the fork's `main` (`6c3bbf4`), all 15 systems re-read at
  200 dpi: the bars carrying a meter the page does not print go **4 → 1**. The one left
  is m10, where the page prints 2/4 and homr read two and a half quarters — a note error,
  which this card is explicitly not allowed to hide. Health stays at **31 findings**, and
  that is the honest result rather than a disappointing one: the four mislabelling
  findings at m12 are gone, and four at m10 have appeared because the wrong label there
  had been *exempting* the bad bar from the check (`unprinted-meter` skips a bar that
  declares a signature of its own).
  Two things this cost. **Bounds become a precondition**: `.systems.json` exists for 5
  of 48 songs and is made by a person dragging in the Systems viewer, or by an AI
  reading `page_images(grid=True)`. Nothing here detects them — #80 measured that and
  it failed badly — so `read_systems` refuses with no bounds and says where they come
  from. And **the crop's resolution turned out to matter**: at 300 dpi, the dpi the
  whole-page benchmark used, B4's first and fifth systems came back as one staff each
  when the page plainly prints two and three; at 200 dpi every system of all seven
  benchmark pages came back with the staves the page prints. `SCAN_DPI` is therefore a
  measured default (env `OMR_SCAN_DPI`), worth re-measuring rather than nudging if a
  page ever comes back short of staves.
  Measured on the frozen benchmark at 200 dpi, ~10s a system: B5 comes out **4-4-4**
  (against a 70-bar single-staff collapse), B4 comes out **2-3-2-3-3** with 18 bars
  (against 26 bars on two staves), and the five two-staff pages — the majority of this
  repertoire — come out of `clean_score` with **the same parts and the same bar counts**
  as the whole-page route. `scan.py` is what calls it; the panel is #116.
- `scan.py` is added by this pull request: the **scan stage**, which is what makes the
  app able to read a score off its PDF rather than be handed one. `omr_systems` could
  read a band and join the bands up, and nothing called it. This does.
  `STAGES` gains **`scan`**, between `register` and `clean`, and **registering inverts**:
  a PDF on its own is now a song and starts at `scan`, while a song handed a score still
  starts at `clean` — importing MusicXML from elsewhere stays the manual route (#86).
  The eight-stage rail costs the 48 existing songs nothing, and the reason is worth
  keeping: the rail marks a stage done when its index is below the current one, so a
  song sitting at `clean` reads `scan` as satisfied without anything being recorded to
  say so. **Having an input score is what being past scanning means.** `import_legacy`
  says the same thing from the other end — a folder with a score is `clean` as it always
  was, and only a folder with nothing but a PDF is `scan`.
  Each band is **padded** by `PAD` (2% of page height, env `SCAN_BAND_PAD`) before it is
  cropped. #112 measured why: B5's second system cropped on its printed bounds came back
  as 2 parts and padded by 60px came back as 3 — the staves the page prints — with the
  same bars, notes and slurs, while tightening the same crop lost five slur tokens,
  because a slur's arc hangs below its staff and a tight edge cuts it off. A fraction
  rather than pixels, for the same reason bounds are: it has to mean the same thing at
  any resolution.
  **One heavy slot per band**, through `omr_systems.read_systems`' own rule, not a
  second one. And **a failed band is a hole, not a failed song**: twenty homr runs is
  twenty chances to fail, and losing the nineteenth must not throw away the eighteen
  that worked. The fragment MusicXML is kept in `songs/<slug>/scan/`, a later run reads
  only what is missing, and the song cannot leave `scan` while a hole is open — an
  assembled score quietly short of a system reads as a complete score and would be
  cleaned, lyricked and sung. A **lost lease** is a hole too: each band takes its own
  slot, so band N+1 asking for a fresh one queues behind whoever the cores went to
  rather than competing with them. What is *not* a hole is anything that is not a way of
  reading a band failing — a missing module, a full disk, a bug — because catching
  broadly turned one unrelated import error into fifteen identical "homr could not read
  this band" holes and hid it completely.
  The assembled input score (`scanned.musicxml`) is **derived**: regenerate it, never
  hand-edit it.
  **The invalidation rule is one idea, built once** (`reconcile`), and this is the part
  most worth reading. Every derived thing records the stamp of what it was made from, and
  `reconcile` walks the chain in dependency order discarding anything whose recorded
  stamp no longer matches the current one. A bounds edit throwing away fragments, a
  re-read throwing away that system's grid answers, and a re-scan clearing the reviewer's
  approval are three rows of that chain rather than three special cases, the cascade is
  free (answers whose fragment is already gone find nothing to have been answered
  against), and a fourth derived thing is a fourth row. Three ad-hoc invalidations is how
  a fourth gets forgotten.
  Two details that carry weight. A fragment holds **two** stamps: the *band* it was read
  from, which decides whether it is still an answer about the page, and the *content*
  that came back, which is what the grid answers, the assembly and the approval hang off
  — so a re-read discards them exactly when the reading came out different, and a re-read
  that came out the same costs a person nothing. And **the band stamp is geometry, not
  index**: `SystemBounds.index` and `Answers` are both keyed positionally, so an inserted
  band silently re-points everything after it, and nothing here compares indices — each
  fragment is checked against the geometry now sitting at its own, which is what makes
  the shift loud.
  Reading a song is where the app finds this out (`_derived` calls `reconcile`, which
  writes only when something really was discarded), so it is said everywhere rather than
  at one route. A song with no scan returns at once, which is every song that predates
  the stage.
  **A fragment also says which homr read it, and that is a third kind of thing: it is
  provenance, and it invalidates nothing.** This pull request proposes it (#154, #157).
  A parse carries the reading engine's commit, label and dirty flag in the MusicXML
  itself as well as in `.song.json` — the file, because a fragment is routinely opened
  straight off disk by something that never opens the app, which is exactly how #129 came
  to spend a session diagnosing a defect that had been fixed months earlier. It is
  deliberately **not** a `reconcile` row: the band and the content are what a fragment was
  *made from*, and the reader is not — the crop is the same crop and the parse is still
  the parse. Making it a stamp would discard 48 songs' fragments and re-read them for
  hours because one person ran one script, to fix what is an information problem. So
  `content_stamp` strips the provenance line before hashing, which means a system re-read
  by a newer homr that came back the same costs its grid answers and the reviewer's
  approval nothing; a reading that came back *different* costs exactly what it always did.
  Upgrading homr discards nothing, re-reads nothing, and lapses no approval. Re-reading
  stays what it already was — a person pressing the per-system or whole-song button.
  Fragments made before this read as **unknown**, which is the true value: "nobody knows
  which homr wrote this" is the state #129 was in, said out loud. `scan.status` puts the
  per-system record and `homr_now` (the engine installed today) on the wire, and the Scan
  panel's **Read by** section and the `Scan vs page` rows show them; the approval banner
  may say it was given under an older homr and never takes it away.
  **A whole-measure rest the boundary moved is written down here, and that half is not
  optional** (#164, proposed by this pull request). `omr.split_measure_rests` straightens
  the bar; `_record_repairs` → `pipeline.record_scan_repairs` writes one `text` entry per
  moved rest into the song's `fixes.json`, naming the printed system, the bar, the staff
  and the voices, and saying that the voice the rest was sharing may still be short of a
  note. The Fix panel lists it as outstanding (`pipeline.free_text_fixes`). Repairing it
  quietly would be worse than leaving it: cleaning pads what the repair leaves, health
  then says nothing, and a bar that was loudly wrong becomes quietly wrong. A `text` entry
  and not a replayable kind, because there is nothing to replay — the repair happens at
  the boundary on every parse, so a re-clean gets it for free, and what is left over is
  the judgement, which is a person's. Re-reading a system **replaces** that system's
  entries rather than adding to them, so a band read five times is one sentence and a
  re-read that came back clean takes the old one away; entries somebody typed are never
  touched. It is written after the fragment is on disk, and a `fixes.json` broken by hand
  costs the record with a line in the log rather than the twenty bands of reading —
  cleaning is where such a file is refused properly.
  Measured end to end on the fixture, real crops and real homr: **15 systems, 201s, no
  holes, 52 bars** — the same bar count as the fixture's own cleaned score — every system
  finding the 2 staves the page prints.
  **A whole reading moves the song on by itself** (#281). From #99 to #281 it did not:
  only a person's OK (`scan.approve`) moved a song off `scan`, on the argument that the
  dangerous parse is the **tidy** one. The owner removed that gate. Checking a whole
  reading against the page could not really be done on that screen, so the OK was
  pressed without looking, and since re-reading a system lapsed it, songs already cleaned
  and lyricked were sent back to `scan` and stayed there. The tidy-but-wrong parse is now
  caught later and bar by bar — homr's `⚠` doubt marks (#245), the Fix panel's other
  readings of an unsure bar (#269), the health findings and Review's approval, the one
  approval left, which still lapses when a re-read changes a system. So `_assemble` moves a
  song on `scan` to `clean`, a re-read never moves a song backwards, and only a **hole**
  keeps or puts a song back on `scan` (`_drop_assembled`), because a score missing a system
  must not be cleaned. `reconcile` also moves on a song the old gate left waiting, and
  says so (`scan.MOVED_ON`, shown and logged as it stands rather than as a discard).
  **A page nobody marked is refused, not scanned.** `pages_without_bands` is a
  precondition rather than a hole to fill later: the scan reads the bands and nothing
  else, so an unmarked page is music that would never be read at all and the assembled
  score would still look complete. Without poppler it answers "no gaps" rather than "every
  page is a gap" — a missing binary must not be indistinguishable from an operator who has
  not drawn them yet.

- `system_finder.py` is added by this pull request: **where the printed systems are**,
  proposed rather than decided. Every band on this host was drawn by a person dragging,
  or by an AI reading a page with a percentage ruler on it — and a song cannot be
  scanned until every page is marked, so that drag is the front door of the whole scan
  route. This proposes the bands and hands them to the **Systems editor unsaved and
  dirty**, exactly as if they had been dragged (`POST /find-systems`, the `Find systems`
  button). Nothing writes `.systems.json`, which is the same argument the scan's own OK
  rests on: the tidy-looking answer is the one worth looking at.
  **Why this can work when #80 could not.** That attempt read the pixels itself —
  morphology for the staff lines, the left-margin bracket for the grouping — and died at
  half a degree of skew, at 20% ink dropout, and on the editions that print no bracket
  (it agreed with the score twice out of nine songs). This asks **homr**, which finds
  staves for a living: the same segmentation network and the same `detect_staff` that
  read the music, stopped before any of it is parsed. Since #144 the whole proposal is
  homr's own command (`--find-system-bounds`, eerovil/homr#65, documented in the fork's
  `SYSTEM_BOUNDS.md`): this module only schedules it a page at a time and turns its JSON
  into `SystemBounds`. It is reached through the same `Engine` the scan uses, so proposing
  bands and reading music are the same homr, and a homr too old to have the command is
  refused by name rather than answered by an app-side copy of the rule. A page is ~8s (a segmentation pass, not a parse)
  and takes **one heavy slot per page**, `omr.py`'s rule unchanged.
  **The grouping is decided by the barlines, and that is the whole idea.** Which staves
  make one system is what homr does not answer — its `MultiStaff` is a brace or a grand
  staff, which choral engraving mostly does not print. The obvious rule fails on the
  measurements: on page 1 of the fixture the gaps *inside* a system run 0.060–0.077 of
  the page and the gaps *between* systems run 0.067–0.086, so no threshold separates
  them. What separates them is what the music says — two staves of one system carry the
  same bars, so their barlines stand at the same x, and two staves of different systems
  do not. Measured across seven pages: 0.6–1.0 agreement within a system, 0.0–0.5 across
  a break. The opening and closing lines are not counted, since every system has them
  wherever its bars fall. The gaps keep one job, as a **veto**: a break must not sit
  *closer* than an ordinary within-system gap. That catches a scan that lost a staff's
  barlines outright (B1b's last system at 0.91 of an ordinary gap, one pair on fixture
  page 3 at 0.97) without touching a real break (1.05 to 1.37).
  Band edges are halfway between systems, so the lyrics under a system's last staff stay
  with it; the first and last get the same room again, clamped to the page — a generous
  band costs white paper and a tight one cuts the words off.
  **Measured against the bands a person actually drew**: all 15 of the fixture's, plus
  B1a and B1b. Every page comes back with the systems it prints, and every internal
  boundary within 0.02 of page height of the hand-drawn one (worst 0.020 on B1b, the
  rest ≤0.014). That is what `test_system_finder.py`'s `omr` tier pins, and it still
  passes through the fork's command; the rule itself is pinned in the fork.
  **`Find systems` no longer asks homr by default; it reads the page itself** (#234,
  `system_finder.quick_bands`). Asking homr is ~8s a page and needs homr installed, and a
  person drags the bands into place anyway, so the default is a deterministic finder that
  takes well under a second a page. It answers #80's two failures: staff lines are found
  in 24 narrow vertical strips and kept when a quarter of the strips agree, so a tilted or
  broken line is still whole across one strip; and two staves are one system when a single
  column of ink spans the gap between them — the systemic barline, which every scan on this
  host prints whether or not it has a bracket. When nothing on a page joins, the gaps decide
  if they clearly come in two sizes. Measured against the hand-drawn bands of all 14
  scanned songs here and B1a/B1b: every page comes back with the number of systems it
  prints, internal boundaries within ~0.035 of the hand ones (it cuts halfway between
  systems). `Ask homr` (`{"method": "homr"}`) is still there, shown only when homr is
  installed. `test_quick_system_finder.py` pins it: drawn pages for the rules, the fixture
  and both B1 scans for the acceptance (needs poppler, no homr).
- The **Scan panel** is added by this pull request (#116), replacing the holding one that
  #115 left. Its whole job is to stop a tidy-looking parse becoming a practice track, and
  every piece of it follows from that.
  **It opens on the Systems editor** (`renderWorkspace` picks `systems` as the first
  document for a song at `scan`), and the Scan button stays disabled until every page has
  bands. No fourth stage for bounds: one stage, one screen, and the thing that must happen
  is the thing in front of you (#103). Bounds are dragged by hand, always — nothing
  proposes them, and #80 measured why.
  **During the scan** it is the raw log, the same one `clean` and `record` show, streamed
  over the per-slug WebSocket. ~20 systems at 16–20s, and on a busy host it stalls between
  them waiting for a heavy slot — `heavy_slot` already says so in that log, which is the
  whole mitigation.
  **A hole is visible, blocking, and retried on its own**: each one is listed with what
  homr said and a button that re-reads that system alone. It was a `prompt()` asking for
  comma-separated numbers.
  **A system that read fine can be read again**, from the panel (numbered buttons) and
  from each row of `Scan vs page`. A scan skips a band whose geometry has not moved, so
  until this the only way to look at a system again — with the other engine, or because
  it came back wrong — was to drag its boundary: editing the page's own geometry to
  provoke a side effect, which then also invalidated the band stamp for a reason that
  was a lie. The cost is said on the row rather than in a dialog, because it is only a
  cost when the reading actually changes: `reconcile` discards that system's answers and
  lapses Review's approval when the content stamp moves, and a re-read that came out the same costs
  nothing. The panel owns the run (it has the engine picker and the log) and publishes
  it as `scanRerun`, so the compare rows re-read through the same call rather than a
  second copy of it — carrying its slug, since a closure from another song would
  otherwise still answer.
  **Which homr reads it is a picker, not a config file** — a `Read with` select over
  `GET /api/homr-engines`, shown only when this host has more than one installed and
  applying to that run and its per-system retries. Trying a homr branch against real
  music otherwise meant editing `.env` or reinstalling over the engine being compared
  against; see the `omr.py` notes for why a branch is installed beside the default.
  **And which homr actually read each system is shown** — a `Read by` section grouping the
  systems by the engine that produced them, the engine installed today beside it, and one
  line saying that a difference has discarded nothing and that re-reading is the button
  above. The `Scan vs page` rows say the same per system, where the reading is being
  judged. Proposed by this pull request (#157); the rule it follows is under `scan.py`.
  **Comparison is system by system**, in a `Scan vs page` viewer tab: each printed crop
  (`/system/{index}`) above what was read off it, engraved through MuseScore
  (`/scan-system/{index}` → `pipeline.scan_system_render`, `-T` so a one-system fragment
  comes back as that system rather than a mostly blank A4). The Fix panel's `/compare`
  idiom, one stage earlier. Page-against-page is not offered, because a whole A4 rendered
  small enough to look at cannot show a slur — this repo has made a confident and
  substantially wrong reading that way once already. A system that could not be read shows
  its reason **in its own row**, so the sequence stays intact instead of the comparison
  quietly skipping a system: that is what "a refused parse is kept and shown" comes to
  here, since nothing in the app refuses a parse on its shape today.
  **There is nothing to approve** (#281; #116 had one explicit OK here). Once every system
  is read the panel says so, says the song is on Clean and that unsure bars are marked `⚠`
  and listed in Fix, and offers a **Go to Clean** button that only changes the view.
  The comparison is redrawn when the scan moves and not otherwise (`_refreshScan`), since
  redrawing reloads every crop; a system read while it is open therefore appears in it.
  On a phone it is the existing pane switcher and the compare rows, both already built
  for 390px.
- **Every clean asks MuseScore 3 whether it would open the result** (#235). MuseScore
  checks a score as it opens it (`Score::sanityCheck`: voice 1 of each staff must fill
  the bar exactly, no other voice may run past it) and calls one that fails
  "corrupted" -- on Sangerhilsen the app crashed instead. Only the app runs that check;
  a command-line export does not, which is why every render went through and nobody
  heard of it until a person opened the file. The one export that does run it is
  `-o x.mlog`, so `pipeline.musescore_check` asks MuseScore itself rather than keeping
  a copy of its rule here. Note MuseScore fills *gaps* with rests while reading, so a
  short voice passes; what fails is a voice that runs past the bar, typically a
  misread triplet. `check_opens_in_musescore` runs after the recorded fixes: each
  staff-bar MuseScore rejects is reset to a whole-bar rest (`rejected_bars.clear_bar`,
  which also cuts a tie or slur reaching into it), the notes taken out are written into
  `fixes.json` as a `text` entry (`source: "musescore-check"`, replaced on every clean
  so a bar a better reading fixed stops being listed), and the score is checked again.
  Anything still refused becomes a `musescore-corrupt` health row
  (`server._health_scan`). The outcome is kept as `verification.musescore` and shown as
  the Review stage's **Opens in MuseScore** row. Without a MuseScore it says "not
  checked", never "fine". The reset loses notes on purpose: there is no reading of the
  page left in such a bar, and a file that will not open blocks the one route a person
  has for putting the right notes back.
- **Hazards guarded:** re-cleaning warns it discards manual edits (the Clean
  button label changes once a cleaned file exists); lyric import uses `--replace`.
  No automatic LLM (users have no API key) — the lyrics stage supports either a
  copy-paste round-trip (copy prompt → user's own AI + PDF → paste JSON back) or
  direct per-system entry.

There are not yet pytest tests for `song_app`; it was smoke-tested end-to-end
(create → per-system grid → clean → health → lyric import overflow warnings)
against the `laulun_aika.mscx` and `simple_1` fixtures.

## How the voice-splitting pipeline works (`src/clean_score/main.py`)

`main(input_path, output_path, add_staffs=None)` parses the
`.mscx` XML and transforms it in passes:

0. `fix_missing_tuplets` (`utils/missing_tuplets.py`) repairs OCR measures where a
   tuplet bracket was dropped from one voice but a parallel voice (any staff, same
   measure index) kept it. It only touches a voice whose ticks don't add up *and*
   where a donor tuplet matches by tick position + base duration + note count, then
   copies the tuplet onto the run and pads the leftover with a rest. Never guesses a
   tuplet without a donor. Runs first (before any split/rebuild), all modes.
0b. `fix_spurious_timesigs` (`utils/spurious_timesigs.py`) removes OCR TimeSig changes
   contradicted by the note content — a change to e.g. 2/4 whose measure actually
   holds 4/4 (matching the *prevailing* meter) is dropped from every staff. It keeps
   genuine changes (content matches the declared sig) and never touches the first
   signature or a measure whose content matches neither. Exact-Fraction durations
   (tuplet/dot-aware). Runs before any split/rebuild, all modes; fixes the per-system
   case where a stray 2/4 made ~18 measures render over-full.
1. `preprocess_corrupted_measures` fixes measures with bad tick totals, then
   `fix_overfull_measures` (`utils/overfull_measures.py`) handles what it declines.
   That pass is all-or-nothing — it shortens the final rest of every over-long voice
   and gives up if any of them ends on a note — so a measure that is consistent
   *except for one voice* stays broken. The second takes the **prevailing meter** as
   the target, requires a voice that already fills it as a witness, and strips only
   what is **not music**: a `location` gap or a trailing rest, and only when it
   accounts for the overrun exactly. It never removes, shortens or adds a note; a
   voice that would need one is left for the health check. The one thing it writes
   rather than removes is the length of **silence**: a voice resting through the bar
   was written to the length the override declared, so once the override goes it
   overruns the corrected bar and MuseScore plays the measure longer than it is
   engraved. No health check sees that — it showed up as a scrolling video the
   renderer refused, 92% of the played notes having no highlight — so such a voice
   becomes a measure rest of the real bar. Lengths count `location`
   gaps, or a voice looks complete on its notes while the file has it occupying more
   of the bar. The fixture's m26 cost two wrong versions before that shape — see its
   STEPS.md.
1b. `share_rests` (`utils/shared_rests.py`) gives both voices of a staff the rest the
   page prints once for the two of them. The scan writes it into one voice only, which
   is right on a shared staff (MuseScore fills the other voice's gap as it reads) and
   wrong the moment the split puts each voice on its own staff: the other voice's bar
   ends early. A gap is filled only with copies of the other voice's rests, and only
   when they cover it exactly; a gap the other voice sings through is a missing note
   and stays for the health check. On Sangerhilsen this was 19 of 29 findings (#235).
   Runs in both modes, since the per-system rebuild pulls one voice at a time too.
2. Decide which staves actually contain 2 voices; only those get split.
   Staff ids are renumbered to leave a gap after each split staff
   (split staff `n` → `n` and `n+1`), tracked in `GLOBALS.STAFF_MAPPING`.
3. Split multi-staff `Part`s so each `Part` owns exactly one `Staff`, then
   duplicate parts/staves for the split.
4. `find_reversed_voices_by_staff_measure` detects measures where voice
   stem direction is reversed, so the correct voice is kept per measure.
5. `handle_staff(staff, "up"|"down"|None)` keeps the matching voice, deletes the
   other, normalizes TimeSig/KeySig/Clef, forces stems up, strips dynamics,
   hairpins, articulations, tempo, harmony, layout breaks, and lengthens
   fermatas (`timeStretch=3`).
5b. **Voicing decides the part names.** A song records `voicing` ("men"/"women"/
   "mixed") when it is created, and `detect_part_types(root, voicing)` uses it
   instead of guessing from clef and pitch range. It has to: a male-choir score is
   written in treble sounding an octave down and editions routinely leave the 8 off
   the clef, so its tenor line reads as 66–82 — squarely soprano — and no pitch rule
   can tell the two apart. men → every treble staff is a Tenor and is **marked
   G8vb**; women → the treble staves split Soprano/Alto; mixed → each clef splits
   into the two voices it carries (S/A, T/B). Marking the clef is not enough on its
   own: a plain-G staff that turns out to be a tenor part was read an octave high,
   so its pitches are moved down twelve semitones (`octave_down`) or the practice
   track sings the line an octave above the men. Staves with no notes are skipped —
   the recording spacer is one, and counting it shifts the split. With no voicing
   recorded the old guess still runs, so existing songs clean as before.
6. `add_missing_ties` recovers OCR-dropped ties by mirroring them from a parallel
   voice that kept the tie at the same tick span. Same pitch is **not** enough on its
   own: an ostinato strikes the pitch a held line ties on the same beats, as separate
   notes (Vieläkö huvittaisi's A1 got 23 ties the page does not print, #284). So the
   target must also sing the donor's rhythm across the bar the tie starts in, and in
   the next bar up to the note it ends on — not after it, since voices that move
   together into a held note often part straight after. Measured over `songs/`: 117
   ties added before, 73 after — 52 stopped and 8 gained (every matching donor is
   tried now, not only the last). Of the 52, 31 are wrong by the page or the lyrics,
   9 were probably real (an overfull bar, a pickup voice) and 12 are unclear.
   Slurs are **not** auto-mirrored: a slur connects different pitches, so it
   can't be pitch-checked, and mirroring one voice's slur onto another produces false
   positives (e.g. copying a bass melisma onto the tenors) — slurs are fixed by hand in
   the score. Then `detect_part_types` (clef + pitch-range heuristics name parts
   S/A/T/B and set clefs), apply names/clefs, strip brackets/barLineSpan.
7. `--add SSAA` appends new empty staves (rests) with the right clef per letter.
8. `mark_scan_damage` runs last, in both modes, and takes out two things a scan gets
   wrong that nothing can repair from the score (#238). A **slur joining two singers**
   (`utils/cross_voice_slurs.py`): homr pairs a slur by the staff's number, so on a
   shared staff it can start in one voice and stop in the other, and after the split
   each half points at nothing, the end half costing that singer a syllable. Both halves
   go. A **bar longer than its time signature** (`utils/long_bars.py`): a misread
   rhythm leaves `len="9/8"` under 4/4 and every part plays an extra eighth; each voice
   is cut at the barline, a note across it shortened or taken out, a tuplet across it
   taken out whole, rests put back only where they spell the gap exactly. Neither
   guesses the right music back. Instead each bar it changed gets a **red mark**
   (`utils/problem_marks.py`): a staff text starting with `⚠`, saying what was taken
   out. The app's clean also marks each bar the MuseScore check resets. Deleting a mark
   in MuseScore is how a person says the bar is fixed: until then health lists it
   (`marked-problem`) and the Fix panel reads it off the score (until #347 a copy went
   into `fixes.json` as a `clean-marker` text entry). The scrolling video
   strips marks (`scrollvideo/score.prepare`), so a forgotten one never reaches a
   practice track.
9. `centre_measure_rests` (`utils/measure_rests.py`, #298) runs last in both modes: a
   rest that alone fills its bar becomes a bar rest (`durationType` `measure`).
   MuseScore 3's MusicXML import writes an ordinary whole rest even for
   `<rest measure="yes"/>`, and MuseScore draws that at the start of the bar rather
   than centred. Only the length changes; a rest that does not fill the bar exactly,
   a dotted one, one in a tuplet, or one a `location` shifts off beat one is left alone.
10. `fix_staff_display` (`utils/staff_display.py`, #354) runs after it, in both modes,
   and changes only what is drawn. A rest the page prints once for two voices is
   written hidden into the second (homr's `print-object="no"`), right on a shared
   staff and missing from the picture once that voice has a staff of its own, so a
   bar with one voice shows its rests. A barline with music after it in its voice moves
   to the bar's end (MuseScore puts a barline where the cursor stands, and a voice
   that stopped early drew a fake bar). A double or repeat barline (never a final one) goes on
   every staff of the bar that has none, since the split left it with the upper
   voice. A plain barline on the last bar goes, since it overrides the final barline
   MuseScore draws there. The same pass runs on the copy every cleaned preview
   (`render_score_pdf(tidy=True)`) and every video (`scrollvideo/score.prepare`)
   renders from, so a song cleaned before it is drawn right without a re-clean,
   which would cost its lyrics. `omr_systems.flatten` also steps to the bar's end
   before a right barline now, so new scans do not write the fake bar at all.

Voice-count anomalies run first: a measure with >2 voices is beyond the splitter
(which makes an upper/lower pair) and is either an OCR glitch or a real multi-way
split. Default (TTY) path = interactive **re-voicing** (`utils/revoice.py`):
`establish_baseline` asks the user to name the normal voices once (e.g. T1,T2,B,
mapping each name to a source staff); `capture_revoice_plan` then prompts per
anomalous measure for a per-voice name list, keeps the voices named for that staff
(reordered to baseline order so the split sees a clean pair), and captures the rest;
after the split, `apply_revoice_plan` routes captured voices — a **new** name gets a
new staff (rests elsewhere), a name belonging to **another** part is **moved** into
that part's output staff (resolved via `printed_to_output`), blank = dropped.
`--no-interactive` (or non-TTY) instead calls `resolve_voice_anomalies`
(`utils/interactive.py`), which reduces to the modal voice count and warns.
Note: which kept voice becomes upper/lower is still decided by the split's
stem/pitch logic, not strictly by the typed order. `≤2`-voice divisi is left alone.

`--per-system` (`utils/per_system.py`) is a separate opt-in mode for scores where the
physical staves change role per printed system (the Laulun aika fixture). It bypasses
the normal split entirely, and the module owns the whole assignment-to-score behavior
behind one entry point, `clean_per_system(root, input_path=..., answers_from=...)`:
it cuts systems at line breaks, describes each system's note-bearing staves
(`system_layout` / `layout_for_file` → `SystemLayout`/`StaffRow`), resolves the
answers, rebuilds the score as one staff per named part (sorted S<A<T<B, then by
number) pulling each part's notes from the declared `(staff, voice)` per system and
filling measure-rests where absent, re-adds the original line breaks on the top staff,
runs the post-rebuild cleanup (`add_missing_ties` + the same decoration strip the split
does), and writes the lyric-routing metaTags. Old Parts/Staves are removed (that's how
part deletion happens). Same name on two staves in a system → first wins.

Assignments are an `Answers` mapping (`{system_index: {staff_id: "T1,T2"}}`) produced
by either of two **adapters at the same seam**: the terminal prompt
(`utils/per_system_prompt.prompt_for_answers`, passed to `clean_per_system` as
`answers_from`) and the web grid (`song_app.pipeline.system_grid` →
`save_system_answers`, after which the rebuild reads them back from the store).
A staff left blank in a system inherits its previous system's answer (`-` =
`per_system.CLEARED` declares nothing and stops that inheritance); the
prompt offers the recorded answer as a `[default]` (Enter reuses it). A part named as
another part plus one lowercase letter (`S1b`, `A1b`) **falls back** to it (#293):
every bar the rebuild would fill with a rest because nothing feeds it — the system
does not name it, or names it on a staff that prints one unstacked line there — gets
the base part's bar instead, and in a system that leaves it out the lyric map sends
the base part's words to it too, whichever lane of the printed staff the base is on
(a per-system `follow` entry beside `map`, so the printed grouping is untouched), unless
the lyric block gives the b-part words of its own. The Review stage's note check (`verification.compare_notes`)
counts those borrowed bars as copies of the base part's notes, not as a difference.
A rest the scan wrote in its own voice or staff stays. Naming the part that way is the
person's reading that the single line is unison, which is what the rebuild otherwise
refuses to guess. **A line left unnamed is said out loud** (#330): the rebuild takes one name per
line, top first, so a two-voice staff answered with one name keeps the upper line and
loses the rest — usually an answer typed once in system 1 and carried into a system
where the page prints two lines there (Lemmen nosto lost ~150 alto notes that way).
`per_system.dropped_voices` finds each such voice with notes; the grid marks the cell
and asks before cleaning, the clean logs it, and `pipeline.record_dropped_voices`
lists it in the Fix panel (`source: "per-system-dropped"`, replaced on every clean).
A chord is different: **one voice may sing a chord**, so notes of a stacked chord
past the last name stay in the lowest named part's chord (`A2, A2b` on a three-note
chord gives A2b the bottom two). They are only logged — the grid warns about written
voices (`StaffRow.lines`), not noteheads (`StaffRow.voices`).
It warns and never blocks: leaving a line out can be the right reading. Answers are
recorded per input file (basename, no extension) in `.persystem_cache.json` at the repo
root (gitignored) via `save_answers`/`saved_answers`/`has_answers`; the file itself is
internal (swap it in tests with `use_answer_file(path)`). A complete
answer set lets per-system mode run **non-interactively** (no TTY) — that is how the web
app cleans headless after the grid is submitted, and how the tests drive it. `main()`
handles per-system mode in an early branch: it runs the OCR measure repairs
(`preprocess_corrupted_measures`, `fix_overfull_measures`), then calls
`clean_per_system` (handing it the prompt adapter only when there is a TTY) and writes
the file — the rebuild details and the metadata are the module's. The repairs used to
sit below the branch, so a per-system score kept every spurious `len` the scanner
wrote: on Kaksi-laulua-krapulasta a bar the page prints as 3/4 stayed 4/4 and ran a
beat long in the practice track, while an ordinary clean of the same file repaired it.
Voice-anomaly resolution stays out on purpose — the answers already say what each
voice is.

**Divisi written as a chord.** An engraver writes two singers holding a chord together
as one voice with the noteheads stacked, so a staff can carry two declared parts
without having two `<voice>` elements. `_max_voices_in_range` therefore counts a chord's
noteheads as parts, and the rebuild gives each declared part its own notehead (top
first; the lowest named part keeps every notehead from its own down, so a chord with
more notes than names stays a chord there). Copying the voice whole instead handed both notes to the upper part and left
the lower one silent — on Kaksi-laulua-krapulasta the lower bass lost the "duu" in m22
entirely, which no health check catches (a chord is well-formed and so is a rest). Where
the stack narrows to one notehead the parts converge in unison rather than one of them
falling silent.

Because the PDF's printed staff numbering
**shifts per system** as parts are omitted (e.g. with T3 absent, the bass becomes
printed staff 3), it writes a per-system `lyricsSystemMap` metaTag (JSON: per
measure-range, `printed_no -> [output staff ids]`) in addition to an identity
`lyricsStaffMap` fallback. The module builds it by grouping parts that
share a source staff into one printed staff (divisi: voice 0 → 'above', voice 1 →
'below') and ordering printed staves by **musical rank** (S<A<T<B, then number) — not
by the OCR's source-staff order, which can be shuffled. `lyric_txt.py` import reads it
(`_read_lyrics_system_map`) and resolves each JSON block via the map for the system
covering its `measure_start`. Tested against `tests/test_files/laulun_aika.mscx` (a
real converted score kept as a fixture).
Caveat: the musical-rank ordering is wrong when an ossia/extra voice is *printed on top*
(e.g. T3 above T1/T2) — then the PDF's printed numbering doesn't match rank order, so a
staff_number-based JSON maps to the wrong voice. The robust fix is to address voices in
the lyric JSON **by part name** (`"parts": ["T3"]`), which bypasses the positional map
entirely; the staff_number/`lyricsSystemMap` path is the fallback for unlabeled scores.

State is passed between passes through the module-level `GLOBALS` singleton
(`utils/globals.py`) — `STAFF_MAPPING`, `REVERSED_VOICES_BY_STAFF_MEASURE`,
etc. `main()` resets these at the start of every run. **Be careful**: this is
mutable global state; don't rely on it across concurrent runs.

Note: lyric handling is **not** part of this pipeline. An older Gemini-based
lyric-fixing flow (and its `pdf_path` plumbing, `utils/gemini_api.py`,
`utils/lyrics.py`) has been removed — the project direction is the
`lyric_txt.py` txt/json flow instead. `main()` only restructures staves/voices;
it deletes any `Lyrics` elements on the staves it splits but does not author or
fix lyric text.

## Lyric placement (`src/clean_score/lyric_txt.py`)

The most intricate module, and the single owner of lyric placement: format
normalization, target routing, chord eligibility, syllable distribution, XML
placement and the diagnostics that fall out of it. It round-trips lyrics between
`.mscx` and a plain text or JSON format, designed so an LLM can fix lyrics against
the original score (e.g. a PDF pasted into the chat) without breaking syllable
alignment. The prompt files `lyric_json_prompt.txt` / `lyrics_txt_prompt.txt` drive
that.

Its interface — all three callers (the CLI file adapters, the AI-JSON paste, the
song app's manual editor) go through these, and nothing else is public:

```python
export_lyrics(root) -> str                      # the TXT projection of the score
place_lyrics(root, source, fmt=, replace=, split=) -> LyricImport
editor_grid(root, systems=) -> EditorGrid       # parts x printed systems, prefilled
slot_counts(root) -> {staff: {measure: n}}      # notes that take a syllable
syllable_slots(root, staff, measure) -> [bool]  # the same, note by note
lyric_parts(root) -> [EditorPart]               # the parts that carry words
blocks_from_cells(grid, cells) -> [block]       # those cells as lyric JSON
export_file(...) / import_file(...) -> LyricImport      # the .txt/.json adapters
```

The last two are added by this pull request, for the Fix panel's slur recorder.
`syllable_slots` is `slot_counts` told per note rather than per bar, and it has to
live here rather than be read off the chords: a note in the *middle* of a slur
carries no marker of its own, so eligibility is stateful along the staff and cannot
be decided by looking at one chord. Both counts now come off a single pass
(`_eligibility_per_measure`), so the per-note answer and the per-bar one cannot
disagree. `lyric_parts` is the part list `editor_grid` already built inline — track
names minus the click/spacer staff — pulled out because more than the lyric editor
now needs to offer a person a list of parts to point at.

`source` is TXT, JSON text, or already-parsed JSON blocks (`fmt` overrides the
sniff). **Diagnostics are returned, never printed**: `LyricImport.mismatches` is a
list of `Mismatch(kind, message, measure_start, measure_end, staff_ids, syllables,
slots)` — kinds `too_many` / `too_few` / `no_systems` / `no_system_for_line` /
`block_count` — plus `filled_measure_starts` for nulls inferred from the printed
systems. `to_dict()` puts them on the wire for the browser; the CLI wrapper prints
`Warning: <message>` itself, so terminal output is unchanged.

- **Eligibility**: only voice 0, verse 1. A note gets a syllable token unless it
  is a slur/tie *continuation* (not the first note of the slur/tie) — those get
  no token. Rests get no token.
- **TXT format**: `# Measure N` headers, then `staffId [syllableCount]: tok1 tok2 ...`
  Tokens are space-separated; hyphens join syllables of a word (`il-man`);
  trailing hyphen = the word continues, and that holds between **any** two tokens,
  not only across a barline; a **leading** hyphen says the same thing looking
  backwards, so a line carried over from the previous system may be written
  `-hil-le`. `_` = eligible note with no lyric. Syllabic state
  (begin/middle/end/single) is reconstructed from hyphenation on import: a syllable
  is `middle` when a word runs both into and out of it, and reading that as `end`
  splits one word in two. It did — `lai-ne-hil-le` was stored as `lai-ne-hil` plus a
  stray `le`, because the continuation rule was applied only to the first token of a
  measure. The syllables still land on the right notes, so no health check, test or
  mismatch count noticed; what showed it was the by-system editor displaying
  `hil le` where the imported JSON said `hil-le`. See `test_lyric_hyphenation.py`.
  (Alignment is per-measure — the token counter resets at each
  barline — so a missing slur/tie only misaligns within its own measure, not the rest
  of the line.)
- **JSON format**: line-by-line; tokens are *distributed across measures* using
  actual chord counts from the score (`_get_chord_counts_per_measure`). The
  PDF-derived format has a `lyrics` array of `{text, staff_number, position,
  verse, parts}`. `staff_number` is the printed staff (top=1); `position` is
  `above`/`below`. These are mapped to **output staff ids** via the
  `lyricsStaffMap` metaTag that `clean_score` writes (`_read_lyrics_staff_map`):
  a printed staff that split into two voices gets the line on both voices when
  only one position appears *in that block* (unison), or split upper/lower when
  both positions appear (divisi is decided **per block**, not globally). An
  explicit `parts` on a lyric overrides the staff_number/position mapping (manual fix
  for the ~inevitable LLM errors). `parts` accepts output staff **ids** *and/or part
  **names*** (`["T1","T2"]`, also a scalar `part`); names resolve via the score's
  trackNames (`_read_part_name_map`). Names are the robust override — immune to
  printed-staff order (e.g. an ossia T3 printed on top), which staff_number cannot
  handle. The current `lyric_json_prompt.txt` has the LLM emit `"parts": []` (empty)
  in **every** lyric so manual overriding is just dropping ids/names into the existing
  array; empty → auto-map by staff_number/position. (An empty list is falsy, so the
  `if parts:` check falls through to the staff_number path — same as omitting it.) Legacy numeric/`_DEFAULT_PART_TO_STAFF` part keys still work. `--split`
  duplicates a part into two staves. When a lyric has no `parts`, import falls back to
  staff_number/position: for `--per-system` scores the printed numbering shifts per
  system, so it uses the per-system `lyricsSystemMap` (`_read_lyrics_system_map`) for the
  block's `measure_start`, else the single `lyricsStaffMap`. Resolution priority per
  lyric: explicit `parts` (ids/names) → staff_number+position via system/staff map.
  A null `measure_start` (the LLM emits null when no measure number is printed at the
  start of a line) is auto-filled by `_fill_missing_measure_starts` (reported as `filled_measure_starts`): blocks are one
  per printed system in order, so each null block takes the start measure of the
  system at its position (`per_system.system_ranges`); explicit values are left alone, and a
  block-count vs system-count mismatch is warned (so the user verifies alignment).
- Import is in-place on the tree, removes verse 2+, and clears lyrics from
  ineligible (spanner-continuation) chords. `--replace` / `clear_existing=True`
  wipes all verse-1 lyrics first (needed because MusicXML imports arrive with
  garbled OCR lyrics); without it, only measures/staves named in the input are
  touched (partial edit).

When editing this file, the export and import paths must stay symmetric — the
test `test_lyric_txt_spanner.py` asserts export→import round-trips back to the
original XML. The `il-man il-ki-rii-vi-` case (where a word's syllables span a
measure boundary) is covered by the two `measure_14` regression tests; the
syllable distribution in `json_lines_to_by_measure` must keep them green.

## Scrolling practice video (`src/scrollvideo/`)

An alternative to the screen-recording pipeline: the video is **rendered from the
score**, so nothing appears on screen, nothing depends on window focus or global
shortcuts, and it can run unattended. One video per voice: the score scrolls
horizontally as a single continuous system, every sounding note lights up, and the
voice the track is for is highlighted strongly while the others stay faint.

Interface — everything else is an implementation detail of these calls. This pull
request proposes replacing the `spacer_per_quarter` grid shown here with
`spacing_ratio`, the biggest step in width-per-beat allowed between neighbouring
bars:

```python
build_videos(mscx_path, out_dir, parts=None, height=2160, width=3840,
             fps=60, with_audio=True, keep_silent=False, emphasise=False,
             combined=True, spacing_ratio=1.3, smooth_seconds=2.0,
             basename=None, system_starts=None, staff_groups=None,
             log=...) -> [video paths]
preview(mscx_path, out_dir, width=3840, height=2160, fps=60, ...) -> payload
```

**The picture is decided once, and there are two things that can be done with it.**
Everything before rasterisation lives in `build.prepare(mscx_path, tmp, ...) ->
Prepared`: the prepared score, the MusicXML and MIDI, the verovio engraving with its
timemap and drawn-id map, `TempoMap.from_midi`, the note and rest events,
`scroll_anchors` + `smooth_scroll`, the spacer-staff crop, the margin viewport, the
duration — and the refusals, which is the part worth naming. A D.C./D.S. jump whose
bars cannot be matched to the engraving, margins that leave no picture and a timeline that misses more than 2% of the played
notes all fail in `prepare`, so **the preview refuses exactly what the render
refuses**, seconds in rather than minutes.

**And this pull request does the same for the pixels.** `build.raster(ready, height)
-> Raster` draws a `Prepared` — the strip, the glyph coverage, and each symbol's
pixel box, with the spacer crop and the margins already applied — at whatever height
is asked for. `build_videos` asks for 2160; `preview` asks for
`preview.PREVIEW_HEIGHT`. One call, so the preview cannot be a second drawing of the
same score, which is what it was while the browser was given SVG: verovio writes
words as `font-family="Times, serif"` and cairosvg and a browser do not pick the same
serif.

`preview.py` writes that `Raster` into `out_dir` as two sets of PNG tiles — the
engraving, and `lit_strip`: the same engraving with every playable glyph already
repainted blue through its coverage by `video.lit_pixels`, transparent everywhere
else — and returns the numbers to play them with: the frame size, where each tile
starts, the duration, the scroll curve as `(times, xs)` **in strip pixels**, and one
entry per symbol that lights up (on, off, staff, its box, and the beat marker's
band). The browser interpolates the curve, copies the window out of the first strip,
blends the marker band, and copies each sounding box out of the second. It works
nothing out about music, layout, time or colour, so it cannot disagree with the
render. Tiles because cairo caps surface dimensions and so do browsers — Chrome
refuses an image past 16384px on a side, which a score reaches. The curve also
carries `jump`, the backward step past which the player must land rather than
interpolate, so a repeat snaps back to the repeated bar instead of sliding across
the music in between.

`combined` also writes **"&lt;base&gt; ALL"** — the same picture with every voice at equal
volume (`render_mix(focus=None)`, muxed like any other track). It is a mix, not a part,
so it never goes through `part_names`; downstream reads the part out of the file name,
which is why it is called ALL, the name the screen recorder always used.

Three MuseScore CLI calls feed it, and each output answers one question:

| output | question | who answers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MusicXML | what does the page look like, and which note is where? | verovio |
| MIDI | *when* does each note sound? | MuseScore's tempo map |
| WAV per voice | what do we hear? | MuseScore's synth |

**The clock is the whole design.** Verovio's timemap and MuseScore's audio are
*different musics*: verovio ignores playback properties, above all the
`timeStretch=3` that `clean_score` puts on fermatas. On the Hanget soi score
verovio says 48.0s where MuseScore renders 59.6s — a video on verovio's clock
drifts up to 14s. But MuseScore writes that stretch into its MIDI export as tempo
changes (120 -> 40 bpm for a fermata), so: **musical position (qstamp) from
verovio, seconds from the MIDI tempo map** (`timing.TempoMap`). Verified against
the MIDI's own note-ons — every highlight lands within 20ms of a note MuseScore
actually plays. This is what `tests/test_sync.py` pins; don't "simplify" it back
to `entry["tstamp"]`.

- `spacing.py` stops the scroll **lurching**, and this pull request changes what it
  does about it. Verovio spaces a measure by what is in it, so a bar of 32nds comes
  out five times wider *per beat* than an equally long bar of quarters — and since
  the scroll follows the notes, the video surges through the sparse bar and crawls
  through the busy one. The fix used to be a staff of evenly spaced rests at one
  subdivision over the whole song (the trick `add_rest_track.qml` already used in
  MuseScore), which works but charges every bar in the song for the worst bar in it.
  Now the rest count is chosen **per bar**, and a song that already scrolls evenly
  gets no rest staff at all.
  What is capped is **width per quarter note**, not raw width, so a 3/4 bar next to
  a 4/4 one is not mistaken for a lurch. The narrowest widths-per-beat that keep
  every neighbouring step inside `DEFAULT_MAX_RATIO` (1.3, `--spacing-ratio`) have a
  closed form — `x_i = max_j natural_j / cap**|i - j|` — so a dense bar widens the
  bars around it and dies away geometrically, rather than lifting the whole song.
  Reaching a target is **measured, not predicted**: verovio spaces each separate
  moment in a bar, so rests laid where the music already sounds change nothing, and
  past that what one more is worth falls away as the bar fills (about a fifth as
  much in a bar of 32nds as in a bar of quarters). `even_engraving` engraves, reads
  the bars back off the SVG's staff lines, works out from that engraving what a rest
  was worth in each bar, and solves again — three or four engravings for a score
  that needs widening, one for a score that does not.
  Two things were got wrong on the way here. The rests must be written as **real
  note values** (`slot_durations` splits a bar into as few as it takes, then halves
  the longest until there are enough): verovio reads what a rest is *written* as and
  not its `<duration>`, so a rest of "one fifth of a bar" is taken for a whole rest
  and quietly drags the part out of time with the audio, with nothing wrong in the
  picture to show it. And the targets are settled **before** any rest is written and
  never moved again — re-solving the cap against the widths a plan produced looks
  like the way to tidy away the last few percent of rounding, and instead it walks
  outwards bar by bar and inflates the whole score by a third and rising. That
  leftover stays, so an engraved step can sit a few percent past the cap.
  A bar's **width** is the distance the scroll covers through it: from its first
  note or rest to the next bar's (`measure_widths`), not its staff lines. Verovio
  draws the clef, key and time signature inside bar 1, which the scroll never
  crosses, and counting them made Kesäaamu's sixteenth pickup read 11x too wide per
  beat and stretch the next nine bars up to 9x (#376). A bar shorter than a quarter
  (`SHORTEST_COMPARED`) is also compared as if it lasted a quarter: a note has a
  smallest drawn width, so a pickup is always "too fast", and smoothing absorbs it
  anyway. It stays in the chain, so it can still be widened to match its neighbours.
  A bar's length is read by following the MusicXML cursor (`note`/`forward` advance
  it, `backup` winds it back), not by adding up every note: a two-voice bar is
  written as one voice after the other and summing reports it as twice as long, so
  every target computed for it would be half what it should be. And everything about
  the staff that can be told not to print is (`print-object="no"` on its name, clef
  and time signature) — it is cropped off the bottom of the strip, but those are
  drawn in the left margin where the crop cannot reach them.
  The staff is injected into the **MusicXML** (after MuseScore has produced it, so
  it never reaches the MIDI or the audio) and cropped back off the bottom of the
  strip by `visible_height` — `build_videos` rasterises proportionally taller so the
  singing staves still fill the frame. The crop margin is deliberately tiny: the
  last staff's lyrics sit in the gap above the spacer, and a generous margin clips
  them. Verovio's own spacing options cannot do this job — `spacingNonLinear: 1.0`
  gets the spread to 1.04x but makes the page 7x wider, leaving less than one bar on
  screen.
- **A fermata holds one beat longer than written** (#380, `score.hold_fermatas`).
  Cleaning writes `timeStretch=3`, which held a dotted half for six seconds at 90
  bpm. The render's copy rewrites every fermata's stretch so it adds one beat (a
  dotted quarter in 6/8), worked out from the span MuseScore stretches: from the
  fermata's beat to the next note or rest on *any* staff. The clock, the audio and
  the preview all come off that copy, so a re-render is enough — no re-clean.
  `FERMATA_HOLD` is in the preview's cache key.
- `score.py` is the only edit made to the score before engraving: parts with nothing
  to sing (percussion, or a staff of only rests — the click track
  `add_rest_track.qml` adds) are dropped, along with the staves they own. They would
  otherwise cost a staff of height in every frame and each get their own pointless
  practice video. The original file is never touched; with nothing to drop it is used
  as-is. `build_videos(..., keep_silent=True)` / `--keep-silent` turns it off.
- **Two parts can share a staff in the picture** (#246): `staff_groups=[("S1",
  "S2"), ("A1", "A2")]`, `--merge S1+S2`, or the Record panel's *Shared staves*
  field (kept in `record.staff_groups`). `score.merge_staves` moves the lower part
  into the upper part's staff as voice 2, on a copy, before MuseScore exports the
  MusicXML, so MuseScore lays out the two voices (stems, rests, beams) itself. The
  staff takes the lower part's clef and is labelled `S1/S2`; words both sing are
  printed once and differing words go on a second line; a bar both rest through
  gets one rest. **Only the picture changes**: the MIDI the clock comes from and
  the score the mixes come from stay unmerged, so the files, the mixes and the
  audio cache are the same as without it, and the 98% alignment check measures the
  merged picture against the real sound. At most two parts a staff, and a part that
  already has two voices in a bar is refused naming the bar. The shared staff's
  clefs are all the lower part's, its later changes included, each put at the same
  beat in voice 1 (`_walk` counts dots, tuplets and `location` gaps to find it);
  the upper part's own clef changes are not drawn.
  `Prepared.staff_of` says which staff each part is drawn on, which is what
  `--emphasise` and the preview's part highlight use.
- `engrave.py` renders with `breaks: "none"` so the whole score is one system
  (one page — a second page is an error, not something to stitch). Notes are
  `<g id=... class="note">` and the timemap's `on`/`off` lists name those same ids;
  that pairing is what makes highlighting possible at all.
  This pull request adds one more thing it owns: **a music symbol written inside a
  piece of text is drawn here, not left to a font.** The quarter note in "♩ = 80" is
  the case that shows up — verovio writes it as a character of its own music font
  and offers that font only as a base64 `@font-face` in the SVG's stylesheet, which
  cairosvg ignores, so the note reached the video as the empty box a font draws for
  a character it has not got (#58). It affected the tempo the app itself adds to a
  score with none (#28) as well as printed ones. `draw_symbol_text` replaces the
  character with the outline verovio ships beside the font — the same outlines every
  symbol it *does* draw is made of — and moves the writing after it along by the
  advance width in `Leipzig.xml`. Only a symbol that **opens** its text is drawn:
  after writing, placing it would mean measuring that writing in whatever font the
  renderer picked, and a symbol in the wrong place is worse than a box. A page with
  no such symbol is returned untouched, so renders that never had the problem stay
  byte-identical.
  This pull request proposes that it also own **which bars print their number**.
  A number on every bar is what one continuous system gets today, and about four
  bars fit on screen, so the picture carries four numbers at once and none of them
  means anything (#78). The useful grouping is the one the singer already has: the
  systems of the printed page. So a number goes on the **first bar of each printed
  system**, even though the video has no systems of its own.
  Verovio has no way to say "these bars and no others", so it is still asked for
  every bar and `engrave.keep_measure_numbers` rubs out the rest. Asking for all of
  them is deliberate rather than lazy: the width of a bar is settled when the page
  is laid out, so the bars `spacing.even_engraving` measures come out the same
  whichever numbers survive, and the choice cannot move the scroll. `None` skips
  the whole pass and returns the page verovio drew, byte for byte.
  Where the grouping comes from is the awkward half. `score.system_starts` reads it
  off the score's own line breaks, which works for a per-system score and for the
  `scroll_video.py` CLI — but **normal-mode cleaning strips line breaks**, so the
  score the app renders usually has none. The app therefore reads them off the
  converted input (`pipeline.printed_system_starts`, the same file the score
  previews already take their breaks from) and passes them as `system_starts`. A
  score with no breaks anywhere — a native MuseScore file never laid out for print
  — falls back to a number every `build.FALLBACK_NUMBER_INTERVAL` bars, which is
  about what a system holds. Falling back to *every* bar would be falling back to
  the complaint. The preview is given the same grouping and it is part of the
  preview's cache key, or a relaid-out source would be played against old numbers.
- `geometry.py` owns two verovio-SVG facts. Coordinates live in the **nested**
  `<svg class="definition-scale" viewBox=...>`, not the root (whose px size is 1/25
  of it), and a note's position is its notehead `<use transform="translate(x, y)">`
  **plus every ancestor `<g transform>`** (verovio emits a page margin; dropping it
  puts every highlight a staff too high). `rasterise` renders the strip in tiles
  because cairo caps surface dimensions at 32767px and a 3-minute score is wider;
  tile edges are cut on the **output pixel grid**, not by converting a fixed unit
  width, so seams don't accumulate rounding drift.
  This pull request proposes **giving each tile only the measures it shows**. A tile
  used to be the entire engraving with the viewBox moved, and cairo then clips — but
  cairosvg has already walked and drawn every node in the document in Python, so the
  clip saves nothing. Measured on Kaksi laulua krapulasta 2 (86 bars, 4 minutes,
  a 1.8 MB SVG of 27 000 nodes): a 1765px-wide tile cost the same 13s as an 8000px
  one. Cost was nodes x tiles, not nodes x picture, and the 4K render pays it nine
  times over. `_Croppable` parses the engraving once and hands each tile the
  measures inside its window; `measure_spans` works out how far a measure's ink
  actually reaches from the shapes themselves — glyph widths taken from `<defs>`,
  curve control points, and the widest a piece of writing could be at its font size
  — so a slur drawn in one bar and carrying on over the next still comes with the
  tile it reaches. **Anything whose reach cannot be worked out counts as drawing
  across the whole page** and is never left out: a tile that took too long is a far
  smaller bug than a notehead rubbed off the score. The picture is byte-identical,
  which is the property under test rather than a hope — `test_geometry` asserts the
  cropped strip and coverage equal the uncropped ones pixel for pixel. Measured on
  that song: `build.raster` for the preview 58s -> 11s (whole preview preparation
  113s -> 27s), and at the video's 2160 rows, 107s -> 28s.
- `timing.smooth_scroll` finishes the job the spacer starts: it averages the scroll
  **speed** over a couple of seconds and integrates it back into positions. Averaging
  positions directly would flatten the curve at both ends — a perfectly even scroll
  would ramp up at the start and down at the finish. Repeats stay sharp: a jump back
  is real motion, and jumps are found in the anchors *before* resampling smears them
  across frames, then each stretch is smoothed on its own. Scrolling at a dead
  constant speed is not an option: measured, it puts the sung note up to 0.45 screens
  from where it belongs, where smoothing keeps it inside 0.02.
  Measured end to end (spacer + 2s smoothing): Käyttäytymisohjeita's speed
  coefficient of variation goes 0.31 -> 0.11 and Venematka's 0.43 -> 0.16, costing
  about half a bar of on-screen music.
- **The sounding note is repainted, not covered.** `geometry.note_coverage` renders
  a second pass with the **noteheads** in a marker colour nothing else uses (pure red
  on a black-and-white engraving) and reads coverage back as red-minus-green: full
  on the head, zero on staff lines and on the lyric that shares the note's group, and
  correctly *partial* on antialiased edges. `video.render` draws those pixels as
  blue-on-white weighted by coverage, so the head itself goes MuseScore blue with a
  smooth outline instead of sitting under a coloured box.
  **Heads only** — stems, flags and beams stay black. That is a deliberate choice
  (colouring stems drags the eye up and down as they flip direction, and a beam is
  shared between notes so it would flicker), and it keeps `NoteGeom.box()` down to
  the head, which is less to composite per frame.
  One gotcha is load-bearing: verovio ships a stylesheet
  (`#id ellipse, #id path, ... {stroke:currentColor}`) that outranks presentation
  attributes on the shapes it names, so marking uses an **inline style**.
  This pull request proposes taking that gotcha one level further down. A notehead
  is a `<use>` of a glyph kept in `<defs>`, so the shapes actually painted are paths
  the rule names by id — and a rule on the path beats a style inherited from the
  `<use>` above it. Marking therefore left the glyph outlined in **black** around its
  red fill, and red-minus-green read that outline as almost no coverage: the whole
  antialiased edge came back at well under half its true value (74 measured as 32 on
  one edge pixel, 157 as 111 on another), the edge was repainted nearly white instead
  of part-blue, and a lit notehead had a staircase for a border — thin open heads,
  half and whole notes, worst of all (#63). Adding `color` to the marker style
  resolves that `currentColor` to the marker too, and coverage then equals the
  engraving's own ink exactly. `test_geometry` pins that: wherever nothing else on
  the page is drawn, coverage must equal the strip's ink, partial pixels included.
  What is left at the border after that is the **codec**, not the picture. h264 4:2:0
  stores colour at half resolution each way, and a notehead is only ~50px across in a
  4K frame, so a thin blue ring picks up blocky colour fringes while the black stem
  beside it stays crisp — luma is full resolution. Measured on one frame against the
  composite it was made from, mean error over the notehead: 4:2:0 1.48, 4:4:4 1.74 at
  x264's own bitrate, i.e. subsampling and not quantisation is the limit
  (`chroma-qp-offset=-6` bought 12%, `-12` no more). 4:4:4 is the only real cure and
  it is not shippable — these are watched on a phone and sent to YouTube, and neither
  decodes High 4:4:4 Predictive.
- `video.py` composites: the engraving is rasterised **once** and a frame is a crop
  of that strip plus the recolouring above. Nothing is
  re-engraved per frame — a four-voice minute of music costs about a minute of CPU
  for all four videos. Scroll position is interpolated from the notes' own x
  positions (`timing.scroll_anchors`), so a fermata's held note simply sits still.
- `audio.py` replaces `export.qml` + AppleScript: a per-voice mix is MIDI controller
  7 on each Part's `<Channel>` in the .mscx, so it is a copy-the-score-and-set-
  volumes edit, then one headless CLI render (~6s per voice). Every CLI call is
  bounded by `CLI_TIMEOUT` — a wedged MuseScore process otherwise hangs the render
  (and the test suite) forever.

Because video and audio come off the same clock, there is **no `audio_delay_ms`**
here — that offset exists in `stemmanauha` only because a screen recording and an
mp3 are captured independently.

**It is deterministic**, and that is deliberate: `engrave.XML_ID_SEED` pins verovio's
element ids (otherwise random per run, which changes nothing visible but makes
renders impossible to diff). Verified by rendering twice: SVG, rasterised strip,
MuseScore's MusicXML/MIDI/WAV and the final mp4 all come out byte-identical. The one
caveat is MuseScore's MusicXML export stamping `<encoding-date>` with today's date,
so a re-render on a later day differs in that file (not in the video).

**The picture is identical for every voice, so it is encoded once.** At 1080p30,
compositing the frames was 3.2s of a 21.5s render and x264 the other 18.3s, so
rendering per voice paid for the encode four times over to change nothing but which
highlights were brighter. Instead: one encode, then each practice track is a
`-c:v copy` mux of that video with its own mix, and the audio mixes run concurrently
(four MuseScore processes: 11.8s together instead of 43s).
`emphasise=True` / `--emphasise` restores per-voice highlighting (that voice bright,
the others faint) and with it a full encode per voice — it is the slow path, and
`test_video.test_mux_puts_audio_on_a_video_without_touching_the_picture` pins that
the default one does not re-encode.

**Output is 3840x2160 @ 60fps** (`--width/--height/--fps`). 60fps because the whole
frame pans horizontally, which is exactly what judders at 30. Measured on
Käyttäytymisohjeita (78 bars, 1451 notes, 2:32, 4 voices): **228s** for all four,
peak RSS 2.9GB, 25MB per video.

     3s  setup      MusicXML + MIDI + engrave
    14s  rasterise  59518x2160 strip = 386 MB
    12s  audio      4 mixes, concurrent
   170s  video      ONCE
    ~5s  mux        4x, stream copy

At 4K the encoder is no longer the bottleneck — moving 25MB frames is. x264 presets
barely change the time (medium 16.7s vs veryfast 13.8s for a 15s probe) but change
the size a lot (24MB vs 47MB), so `DEFAULT_PRESET` stays `medium`. For the same
reason `video.render` fills **one reused frame buffer** rather than copying a blank
per frame, and `geometry.rasterise` fills a single strip buffer instead of
`hstack`ing tiles — at 4K each of those would otherwise double hundreds of MB of
traffic or footprint. Strip memory is ~2.5MB per second of music at 2160p, so a
6-minute score needs roughly 900MB; that is the number to watch if a very long score
ever fails.

Three behaviours worth knowing:

- **Tie continuations get their own highlight.** Verovio's timemap emits an `on` for
  the second note of a tie; MuseScore's MIDI (correctly) does not retrigger. The
  highlight moves to the tied notehead while the sound continues — which is what a
  singer follows, and matches MuseScore's own playback cursor.
- **Section repeats and voltas work, and the scroll jumps back.** Verovio *expands*
  repeats in its timemap exactly as MuseScore does, so the played timeline is already
  unrolled and the qstamp axis still matches MIDI ticks. The section is engraved once,
  so the repeat pass sounds under suffixed ids (`xyz-rend2`) that are not drawn;
  `engrave._drawn_ids` maps them back with verovio's `getNotatedIdForElement`. A
  repeated note therefore gets one highlight event per pass, and the scroll walks
  back to where that section is drawn. One thing verovio gets wrong on the way: a
  whole-bar rest in the bar a repeat jumps back to is timed in the meter in force *at
  the jump* (a 7/4 bar repeating to a 4/4 one where a part rests made Kantajani's
  highlights 2.25s late and the render was refused, #313), so `engrave.retime_repeats` puts every bar of the played
  timeline back at its MusicXML length.
- **D.C./D.S. jumps are followed in MuseScore's own bar order** (#314; `playorder.py`).
  They were refused until then, because verovio follows them only sometimes: it gets
  Illan viimeinen tango's D.S. al Coda right, and plays Jouluriemua's two D.C.s as
  two passes (181 quarters) where MuseScore plays three (257.5). So a score with a
  `Jump` (a `Marker` alone is only a label) asks MuseScore which bars it plays, in
  order — the `.mpos` export, written off the same repeat list playback uses — rather
  than keeping a second copy of the segno/coda/Fine rules here. Each printed bar's
  timing is taken from the first time verovio's timemap plays it, and the bars are
  laid end to end in that order into a new timemap, which everything downstream reads
  as it would verovio's. A note held into a bar the jump skips stops at the barline.
  Where the next bar played is not the next one printed is a **cut**
  (`Prepared.cuts`): `timing.cut_anchors` holds the scroll until the jump and lands it
  on the far side, and `smooth_scroll` starts a fresh stretch there, because a jump
  *forward* to a coda is no bigger a step than ordinary music on a long page. A bar
  count that differs between MuseScore and the engraving, or a bar MuseScore plays
  that verovio never timed, is refused by name; the 98% alignment check below still
  has the last word. A score without a `Jump` takes exactly the old path, except
  that a score with repeat signs or voltas asks for the `.mpos` too and follows it
  when verovio's bar order differs (#374): a scan writes a "2." ending as a bracket
  that opens and never closes, MuseScore plays the repeat as printed, and verovio
  then expands no repeat at all (Kristallen den fina 74%, Kun poijat ne raitilla 65%).
  `test_files/voltas.mscx` is that shape.
- **Every render is verified against the audio before it ships.** `build.alignment`
  checks what fraction of highlights land within 200ms of a note MuseScore actually
  strikes, and refuses below 98%. That is the real property, so it catches timeline
  disagreements we did not think to look for — don't replace it with a structural
  check on the markup.

Tests (`src/scrollvideo/tests/`) — `test_sync.py` needs the MuseScore CLI and skips
without it, like the browser tests:

- `test_sync.py` — the clock, end to end on a fixture with a 3x fermata: every
  highlight lands within 20ms of a MIDI note-on, the last note ends with the audio,
  and a guard test spelling out what verovio's own clock *would* have shipped.
- `test_measure_numbers.py` — added by this pull request: a line break starts the
  *next* system and one on the last bar starts nothing, the caller's grouping beats
  the score's, a score with no breaks gets an interval and not every bar, and — the
  two that guard the render — the chosen page has the same bar widths, page width
  and notes as the fully numbered one, and every pixel of it is the same or lighter,
  so removing a number cannot have moved anything.
- `test_symbol_text.py` — a tempo mark's note is drawn rather than left to a font, it
  is ink on the page above the music (measured against the same page with the drawing
  taken out again, so the "= 80" beside it cannot satisfy the reading), the writing
  after it moves along by the font's advance, and a symbol that follows writing is
  deliberately left alone.
- `test_preview.py` — the preview against the render it is a preview of: the same
  scroll curve number for number, a fermata timed on MuseScore's clock rather than
  verovio's, the symbols `place` would light, a repeat that stays one backward jump,
  the same refusals, and that nothing is encoded and no voice is mixed. This pull
  request adds the tests that only became possible once the preview carried pixels:
  the strip is byte-identical to `build.raster`'s, a lit glyph is
  `video.lit_pixels`'s own blue, a bottom margin shows white rather than the spacer
  staff — and, the one that pins the lot, a frame composed out of the payload the way
  `scroll_preview.js` composes it, against real frames from `video.render` written as
  raw pixels so the comparison is not arguing with a codec.
- `test_playorder.py` — following a D.C./D.S. jump (#314). On hand-written timemaps:
  bars laid out in the given order with continuous time, a D.S. al Coda giving one cut
  back and one forward, a held note stopping at the barline of a skipped bar, a bar
  first timed in a repeat pass mapping back to the page, and the two refusals. Then,
  with MuseScore, on `dal_segno.mscx` and `da_capo.mscx` (five bars made from
  `fermata.mscx`): every highlight within 20ms of a note MuseScore plays, the last one
  ending with the audio, and the scroll landing at each jump within a frame with time
  never stepping backwards. `test_preview.py` adds that the preview follows the jump
  with `prepare`'s own curve.
- `test_geometry.py` — the ancestor-translate offset, the definition-scale viewBox,
  and that tiled rasterisation matches single-shot (alignment pinned; antialiasing
  along a seam is allowed to differ by a pixel). This pull request adds the
  cropping's own rules: cropped tiles equal uncropped ones pixel for pixel, a tile
  really is handed less of the score, a slur running past its own barline still
  comes with the tile it reaches, and a shape we cannot measure is never left out.
- `test_timing.py` — TempoMap arithmetic (a 3x fermata window), notes still sounding
  at the end being closed rather than dropped.
- `test_video.py` — highlights land on the right staff, and are present while a note
  sounds and gone after it stops (decoded back out of the rendered mp4).
- `test_geometry.py` also pins the highlight: the note box is the head and stops short
  of the stem, marking paints the head via an inline style but leaves the stem and the
  lyric alone, and coverage marks strictly less than all the ink. `test_video.py` pins that colour lands only where
  the glyph is — a leak outside it means someone reintroduced the box.
- `src/song_app/tests/test_record_renderers.py` — the Record stage routes to the
  scrolling renderer by default, passes the size choice through, still reaches the
  screen recorder on request, refuses to render without a cleaned score, names the
  files so review and upload find them, and cannot be killed by progress reporting.
  This pull request adds that the render holds a heavy slot **across** the render
  rather than merely asking for one, and that losing it stops the render.
- `src/song_app/tests/test_heavy_slot.py` — added by this pull request, and mostly
  about what happens when the deck does not co-operate: an unconfigured deck, an
  unreachable one, one that refuses, and one that never frees a slot all leave the
  work running; the lease is released when the work raises; it is renewed while the
  work runs and not after; a heartbeat that could not be *sent* is retried until the
  lease would have expired; and a heartbeat answering 404 stops the work where it next
  reports progress. `test_record_renderers.py` carries the same loss end to end
  through the record path: the render stops, the song says why, and the stage stays
  on Record.
- `src/song_app/tests/test_record_panel_ui.py` — the same choice in a real browser:
  both renderers offered, scrolling preselected, controls swap, and the run button
  actually posts `renderer` (browser-marked, skips without Playwright). This pull
  request adds the queue as a person sees it: a busy host says so in the song's live
  log, then says the slot came free, then renders.
- `src/song_app/tests/test_scroll_preview.py` / `test_scroll_preview_ui.py` — the
  endpoint's caching and its invalidation (score edited, or any setting that moves
  the picture), that previewing changes nothing about the song, and a refusal
  arriving as a message; then the player itself in a browser — play, pause, seek,
  restart, the repeat landing rather than sliding, the sounding glyph turning blue,
  the beat marker following it, a phone-sized layout, and a rebuilt preview after the
  score changes. This pull request adds the folder cache's own rules (a rebuild
  empties the old tiles; a tile name off the wire cannot reach out of the folder),
  and re-grounds the browser tests: **the stub strip encodes each column's own x
  position in its pixels** (`(x >> 8, x & 255, 0)`), so with no viewBox left to read,
  one pixel off the canvas says exactly where the player has scrolled to and every
  assertion is made by looking at what is on screen. The drawing is stubbed in both,
  so neither needs MuseScore.
- `test_spacing.py` — this pull request rewrites it around the adaptive rule: a
  score of ordinary bars is engraved at its natural width with no rest staff, the
  reported 4-note/32-note pair comes back inside the cap, one dense bar among
  sixteen sparse ones widens its neighbours and leaves the far end untouched, and a
  2/4 bar among 4/4 bars is not widened for being short. Plus the mechanism's own
  rules: more rests widen a bar and never narrow it, a bar does not budge until it
  is asked for more moments than its music already has, the rests keep the music in
  time (the written-value bug, caught by comparing the timemap against the unspaced
  score), a two-voice bar is not read as twice as long, a bar of a length no rest
  spells gets a whole-measure rest rather than an approximation, a count that
  divides the bar unevenly is still written, and where the crop falls.
- `test_timing.py` also pins the smoothing: an already-even scroll is left exactly
  even (the edge-ramp bug), uneven spacing is evened out, and a repeat stays one
  clean jump rather than three smeared ones.
- `test_score.py` — which parts count as silent, that dropping one takes its staff
  with it, and that the original file is never modified.
- `test_merge_staves.py` — sharing a staff: which voice each part lands in, the
  clef, the label, words once or on a second line, one rest for two, stems left to
  MuseScore, the refusals, and (with MuseScore) two parts engraving as one staff
  with the same notes and the same unmerged audio source.
- `test_audio.py` / `test_build.py` — the volume edit (replaced, not duplicated;
  pan/program untouched), the D.C.-jump refusal, that section repeats/voltas are
  *not* refused, and the alignment measure itself (full when highlights match the
  MIDI, falling when they drift).
- `tests/test_files/fermata.mscx` — `simple_1_output` with a `timeStretch=3` fermata
  added to measure 1 (4.00s -> 5.00s of MIDI as written; 4.50s once `score.prepare`
  holds it one beat, which `test_sync` pins). `fermata.musicxml` is the same score
  pre-converted so engraving tests need no MuseScore.

## Reading a scanned score (playbook)

Hard-won in the session that built `pdf_systems`, where reading whole rendered pages
produced a confident, tidy and substantially wrong conclusion. If you are an agent
about to read a score off a PDF, start here.

**Crop before concluding anything.** A whole A4 rendered small enough to look at
cannot show a slur or a notehead. Use `pdf_systems.crop_systems` (400 dpi, one band,
~0.9s) and read a system at a time. `page_images(grid=True)` overlays a labelled
percentage scale for reading system boundaries off — never estimate them by eye, that
is how a crop ends up clipping the lyric line under the bottom staff.

**Let the arithmetic check the reading.** `lyric_txt.slot_counts(root)` gives
`[staff][measure] = notes that take a syllable`. Every correct correction predicts
its slot count *before* being encoded and lands on it exactly; a reading that needs
the numbers bent to fit is wrong. `place_lyrics` returns the same numbers as
`Mismatch` records.

**The direction of a mismatch says what kind of problem it is:**

| | means |
|---|---|
| `too_many` | the **reading** is wrong — too many syllables for the notes |
| `too_few`, by a lot | a voice **sharing** another staff's words (below) — **or** a **runaway slur** swallowing the slots (next paragraph) |
| `too_few`, by exactly one or two | usually a **dropped slur** — a melisma the OCR lost |
| all `too_few`, never `too_many` | do **not** conclude "missing slurs" from this alone; that inference was made once and was mostly wrong |

**Look at the slurs before you conclude "sharing".** The two readings of a large
`too_few` want opposite responses — sharing is correct engraving and is written down
in the lyric JSON, a runaway slur is a defect in the score and has to come out of it —
and they are easy to confuse, because a runaway is invisible in the numbers and points
straight at the wrong answer. What tells them apart: sharing shows up as a voice whose
per-measure note counts match another voice's exactly, while a runaway shows up as
**one bar losing most of its slots to a slur crossing several barlines**. Look for the
long slur first, since that is a single check: `lyric_txt.syllable_slots(root, staff,
measure)` says note by note which are being swallowed. homr now pairs its own slurs
(eerovil/homr#62), which leaves a score scanned with an older homr, or one from another
OMR tool, as the cases to watch for.

**Voices sing words that are not printed under them.** Older choral engraving prints
a text once and expects more than one voice to use it, so notes with no text beneath
are the norm, not an anomaly:

- Text set *between* the staves usually serves both.
- A voice's own line can start part-way through a system; before that it sings the
  other staff's words (bass sharing the tenor line for two measures, then breaking
  away at its own entry).
- A voice whose per-measure note counts **match another voice's exactly** is very
  likely singing that voice's words — in the fixture the upper bass doubles the tenor
  rhythm throughout.
- A measure where *every* voice has the same note count and one text is printed is a
  unison convergence: all of them sing it.

**Check continuity across system breaks.** Each voice's text must join into a
sentence from one system to the next. When it is ambiguous which staff a line between
two staves belongs to, this decides it — only one assignment leaves every voice with
a sentence.

Worked through twice, with the wrong turn left in, in
`fixtures/virta-venhetta-vie/STEPS.md`.

## MuseScore plugins (`plugins/`)

QML for MuseScore 3.x. **Install by copying/symlinking into
`~/Documents/MuseScore3/Plugins`** (MuseScore loads them from there, not from
this repo). After changing a plugin, reload it in MuseScore (Plugins → Plugin
Manager, or restart). They cannot be unit-tested from Python.

- `export.qml` — export per-voice mp3s, each choir voice mixed louder than the
  rest; supports SSAA/SATB/TTBB/SAM naming. Triggered by the recording script.
- `voice2.qml` — split a selection into two voices (lowest note → voice 2).
- `copylyrics.qml` — copy topmost-staff lyrics down to lower staves by tick.
- `replacelyrics.qml` — search/replace across hyphenated lyric syllables.
- `add_rest_track.qml` — add a spacer staff of 16th rests (even measure spacing).
- `mute.qml` — toggle mute / set volume on all instruments.
- `lyric_export_import.qml` — in-app lyric TSV transfer with highlighting.

## Recording pipeline (`src/stemmanauha/`, macOS only)

`record_stemmanauha.py MySong` → `create_video.run()`:
mp3 export (AppleScript drives MuseScore's `export.qml`) → record play-along
video via QuickRecorder (AppleScript + OBS websocket) → `ffmpeg` merges each
voice mp3 onto the video (audio sync offset `audio_delay_ms`, default 1300ms) →
optional YouTube upload.

`run()` takes granular controls (used by the web app, see above): `audio_delay_ms`
(the merge sync offset), `redo_mp3` / `redo_video` (selectively clear and redo a
stage — each step otherwise skips if its output already exists), and `merge_only`
(re-merge existing media with a new offset, no recording — the fast fix when the
sync is just off). `merge_mp3_to_video(..., force=True)` overwrites existing
merged outputs, and it identifies the **raw** recording as the `.mov` whose name
is not one of the `"<song> <part>.mov"` merge outputs (so re-merging never feeds
its own output back in). Before the per-voice merges it downscales the recording
**once** in place to `MAX_VIDEO_HEIGHT` (env, default 1080; 0 disables) via
`_cap_video_height` — Retina screen recordings are 1440p+, and YouTube would serve
that; capping keeps the merges `-c:v copy` (one re-encode, not one per voice).
Already-merged songs need a **re-merge** (force) to regenerate at 1080p.

This is heavily environment-dependent: it relies on specific macOS apps, global
keyboard shortcuts wired in QuickRecorder/MuseScore, `MUSESCORE_EXPORT_PATH`,
`VIDEO_EXPORT_PATH`, and `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`. It is not portable or testable in
CI. The `.scpt` AppleScript files and the keyboard shortcuts described in
`TOOLS.md`/`record_stemmanauha.py --help` must match. The CLI still skips a
stage when its output exists; the web app exposes the redo flags instead.

## This host: the live app, the deploy, the board

The app is not something someone starts when they want it. It runs as a systemd **user**
service from this very checkout, `song-app.service` on 127.0.0.1:8123. The units are
committed under `systemd/` — the live copies live in `~/.config/systemd/user/`, so an
edit here is not live until it is copied over and `systemctl --user daemon-reload` has
run.

The phone reaches it over Tailscale at **https://choir.taile8d16e.ts.net/**, a Tailscale
*service* (`svc:choir`) whose 443 handler proxies to `http://127.0.0.1:8123`. The older
`https://bazzite.taile8d16e.ts.net:8123` still works and points at the same app. That
config lives in tailscaled, not in this repo:

```bash
tailscale serve --service=svc:choir --https=443 --set-path=/ http://127.0.0.1:8123
```

Port 8000 is **not** available on this host — a podman container (`sos`, the Outdoor dev
server) has it, and `song.py` silently falls back to the next free port rather than
failing, so an app "started on 8000" ends up somewhere like 8002 with nothing pointing at
it. The two addresses are different **origins**, so an installed PWA does not follow a
move from one to the other; it has to be installed again (see the PWA identity notes).

A merge deploys itself. `song-app-deploy.timer` runs `scripts/deploy-song-app.sh
--unattended` every two minutes: it fast-forwards `main` to `origin/main`, installs
requirements, restarts the app and waits for `/healthz` to say `ok`. **It refuses more
often than it acts** — a dirty checkout, another branch, or local commits that are not
on `origin/main` all mean someone is working here, and deploying would either destroy
that work or ship a commit GitHub has never seen. Nothing to deploy is a no-op with no
restart, deliberately: a restart is the evidence a release waits for, so a spurious one
would tell the board a merge had reached the host when it had not.

"Dirty" has to mean *a person edited the checkout*, and one thing that is not that
used to trip it: the poller checks each issue out into `.worktrees/issue-N` **inside
this repo**, so `git status --porcelain` listed an untracked `.worktrees/` and the
deploy refused for as long as any agent was working. It refused silently as far as the
board was concerned — the timer failed every two minutes, the app kept serving old
code, and the card that had just merged was told its production deploy had failed. This
change gitignores `.worktrees/`. A worktree is a separate working directory, so a
fast-forward of `main` cannot disturb one; leaving it visible bought nothing and cost
every deploy made while a card was open.

`/healthz` exists for that watcher. It returns `{"status": "ok"}` and touches nothing —
it has to answer while a clean or a video render is occupying the worker threads.

**Song chats need three keys in `.env`, and for a month they were not there.** The
AgentDeck mapping added in #48 reads `AGENTDECK_URL`, `AGENTDECK_API_URL` and
`AGENTDECK_ACCOUNT_KEY`, and they were only ever written to `.env.default` — blank.
`.env` exists on this host, so `.env.default` is never loaded, and every song answered
`unconfigured` (#52). They are now set: browser URL
`https://bazzite.taile8d16e.ts.net` (the tailnet origin AgentDeck itself is served
from, so the phone can open it), API URL `http://127.0.0.1:8756`, account
`claude_code:main`. `.env` is gitignored, so this is host state, not something a
checkout carries — a second host has to be told again. One trap when testing by hand:
an AgentDeck-owned agent chat already exports `AGENTDECK_URL` as the loopback base for
its own API calls, and `load_dotenv` does not override a variable that is already set,
so `./song.py` run from such a chat persists the loopback origin into the song's
`.song.json`. The service has no such variable; clear them (`env -u AGENTDECK_URL`)
before reading anything into a conclusion.

**homr lives at `~/.local/share/musescore-choir-plugins/homr-venv` on this host**, put
there by `scripts/install-homr.sh` and pointed at by nothing in `.env` because that is
the script's own default. It is host state, like `.venv` — but unlike the `omr`
distrobox container it replaces, a second host reproduces it by running one committed
script. The deploy does not touch it, on purpose: it is not in `pip-requirements.txt`,
so a merge cannot churn 150 MB of model weights, and `/healthz` does not know it
exists.

Issues are worked from a GitHub Project board by the AgentDeck poller (instance
`musescore`, unit `agentdeck-poller@musescore.timer`). Its manifest is **not** in this
repo: it lives in `~/agentdeck/poller/manifests/musescore/`, with every project's
alongside it, and the host half (paths, account, token) is the uncommitted overlay in
`~/.local/share/agentdeck/poller/instances/musescore/`. Comment `/claude <what you want>`
on an issue to start or steer work; `/merge` from **In review** releases it. Nothing
merges without that comment.

## Conventions & gotchas

- Everything operates on **uncompressed `.mscx`** XML. `.mscz` is just a zip;
  `clean_score.py` unzips it, and MusicXML is converted via the MuseScore CLI
  (`MUSESCORE_CLI_PATH`).
- Durations: `lyric_txt.py` reads `<Division>` from the score for real ticks;
  `utils/utils.py` uses a fixed `RESOLUTION=128`. Keep them straight — they are
  different tick bases.
- Use `lxml.etree` everywhere (not `xml.etree`); code relies on `getparent()`,
  XPath like `.//Spanner[@type='Slur']`, and `pretty_print`.
- `songs/`, `backup/`, `playlists.txt`, `token.pickle`, `client_secrets.json`,
  and `.env` are gitignored — don't commit generated output or credentials.
- Part naming heuristics in `part_types.py` use clef + MIDI pitch thresholds
  (e.g. lowest < 50 = Bass) — adjust thresholds there, not in `main.py`.
