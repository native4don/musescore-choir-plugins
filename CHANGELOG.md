# Changelog

What changed, newest first. The project has no version numbers; changes are
grouped by the day they were merged, and each line names its pull request
(`#123`) on GitHub. Changes that only touch tests, measurements or the notes for
developers are listed under *Behind the scenes*.

## 2026-10-05

- Per-system cleaning no longer leaves tenors read off a plain treble staff an
  octave too high, and scanned songs no longer share one set of grid answers. (#266)

## 2026-10-04

- The README is now about the web app, with screenshots; the command-line tools
  and MuseScore plugins moved to TOOLS.md, and this changelog was added. (#264)
- On a phone, the stage list moves into a ☰ drawer, the bottom bar stays on
  screen, and the score zooms itself (pinch, or − / + / Fit). (#263)
- The homr install box moved from the Library page to the Scan panel, where homr
  is used. (#262)
- The header has an always-visible **Reload** button. (#259)
- Page images cut from a PDF follow the PDF they came from, so a replaced PDF is
  not shown with old pictures. (#256)
- A health re-check started by the file watcher no longer overwrites a lyric import
  that saved at the same moment. (#254)
- Lyric slots: a slur that starts on a tied-into note, or on a slur end, still
  takes a syllable. (#253)
- **Install or update homr from the Library page**, with its log shown while it
  runs; scans wait while it installs. (#250)
- Scrolling video: **two parts can share a staff** in the picture (the Record
  panel's *Shared staves*). (#248)
- Scanned songs label their printed systems with their bar numbers. (#244)
- New song: leaving the name blank uses the file's own name. (#242)
- Clean takes out slurs that jump from one singer to another and bars longer than
  their time signature, and marks each changed bar in red until a person deletes
  the mark. (#239)
- Clean gives both voices a rest the page prints once for the two of them, and
  resets bars MuseScore 3 would call corrupted; the Review stage says whether the
  file opens in MuseScore. (#237)
- **Find systems** reads the page itself in under a second, without homr; *Ask
  homr* is still there when homr is installed. (#236)
- Scan panel: read every system again with one press. (#232)
- Scanning follows the newest homr: its own note positions are ignored and the
  title is not read. (#224)
- The app's own copies of slur repair and system finding were removed; homr does
  both now. (#222)
- Behind the scenes: kept the app's own system cropping after measuring homr's
  (#226); added Talviuni to the reviewed reference songs (#229, #233); developer
  notes (#218, #228).

## 2026-09-22

- **Download the cleaned score and upload a fixed one back**, so a score can be
  fixed in MuseScore on another computer or from a phone. (#217)
- Behind the scenes: corrected a measurement claim in the developer notes. (#215)

## 2026-09-12

- Find systems uses homr's supported printed-system command. (#214)

## 2026-09-06

- Every scanned system records which homr read it, and the Scan panel shows it.
  (#159)
- A whole-bar rest that shares a voice with notes is moved to a voice of its own,
  and the move is written into the Fix list for a person to check. (#165)
- Review and Fix say outright when a scan is too damaged to be worth repairing,
  instead of only counting problems. (#171)
- Scanned systems keep each note on the beat homr read it on. (#180)
- The time signature of a scanned score is worked out from the bars, since homr
  can only guess the top number. (#184)
- A singer keeps their part across the join between two scanned systems. (#189)
- Behind the scenes: measurements and corrections to them (#163, #194, #198, #199,
  #201), and where an OMR fix belongs (#176).

## 2026-09-05

- Behind the scenes: wrote down which repository an OMR fix belongs in. (#143)

## 2026-09-04

- A scanned band gets only the staves its own system prints. (#140)
- Notation such as clefs and keys carries across joined systems. (#139)
- Behind the scenes: judge a scan against songs the choir has already sung. (#138)

## 2026-09-03

- A system that was read again can be seen again in the comparison. (#136)
- Behind the scenes: recorded where homr runs fastest on this host. (#137)

## 2026-09-02

- **A song can be started from its PDF alone.** (#128)
- A system that read fine can be read again. (#132)
- Run a homr branch from a local checkout, chosen per scan, and name exactly which
  homr each choice is. (#131, #133, #134)
- The app proposes the printed-system bands instead of only letting you draw
  them. (#135)

## 2026-09-01

- **The Scan stage**: read a score off its PDF one printed system at a time with
  homr, see each system next to the page, and approve the result. (#108, #109,
  #111, #119, #121)
- Slurs homr invented are dropped. (#114)
- A score where most bars set their own length gets one health finding that
  counts the odd bars, instead of none. (#126)
- The by-system lyric editor keeps empty slots. (#89)
- **Record a missing slur from the Fix panel.** (#90)
- System crops follow the score they came from. (#91)
- The video render waits its turn behind other heavy jobs on the host. (#102)
- Behind the scenes: committed public-domain benchmark pages. (#120)

## 2026-08-30

- The video numbers the bar at the start of each printed system, not every bar.
  (#79)

## 2026-08-28

- On a phone, the bottom bar stays clear of the browser's toolbar. (#55)

## 2026-08-26

- The scroll preview can play **synchronized audio**, off until asked for.
  (#67, #70)
- Redesigned Review and Record for phones; the preview moved into the viewer.
  (#68)
- Videos render much faster: each tile is drawn from only the music it shows.
  (#71)
- Bar widths in the video change gradually, so the scroll does not lurch. (#73)
- The video's bottom margin starts at 5%, and the framing chosen in a preview is
  remembered. (#75, #76)
- A lit notehead keeps a clean edge. (#65)
- Behind the scenes: the full test suite is left to CI. (#77)

## 2026-08-25

- **Preview the scrolling video in the browser before rendering**, using the
  render's own pixels. (#61, #62)
- Video margins are adjustable. (#50)
- The note in a tempo mark ("♩ = 80") is drawn instead of showing as a box. (#59)
- A recorded fix can be a plain sentence. (#57)
- A word split by a barline stays one word. (#45)
- **Installable on a phone's home screen** (PWA). (#41, #43)
- Songs link to AgentDeck chats, and the button says why it cannot act when it
  cannot. (#51, #53)
- Rendering refreshes, audio progress and reload state are clearer. (#39)
- Behind the scenes: CI on every pull request (#36); the live app's address
  (#44); glyph alignment check (#49).

## 2026-08-24

- The browser no longer serves stale app code or old videos. (#35)
- Render progress is shown, and 4K renders are faster. (#27)
- Choose a tempo when the score has none. (#30)
- Scrolling video: a beat marker, rests highlighted, and whole-bar rests no longer
  pull the focus. (#12, #25, #32)
- A song's recorded fixes are applied every time it is cleaned. (#10)
- A **New issue** button in the header. (#24)
- The PDF viewer scrolls on a phone. (#16)
- Clearer lyric hyphen guidance. (#33)
- Behind the scenes: reliable test suite (#14), easier pipeline checks (#18),
  agent worktrees no longer block the deploy (#19), a background-render fix (#21).

## 2026-08-23

- **Scrolling practice videos rendered from the score**, now the Record stage's
  default. (#7)
- Per-system scores are repaired like any other, and two singers written as one
  chord are split. (#9)
- Lyric import returns its warnings as data the app can point at. (#5)
- The per-system grid understands `-` (this staff is silent from here). (#4)
- Behind the scenes: per-system answers behind one interface (#3); a browser test
  for clean → lyrics (#6); new-machine setup notes (#8).

## Before August 2026

The project started in 2020 as a set of MuseScore 3 plugins (`export.qml`,
`voice2.qml`, lyric copy and replace, the rest-track spacer), grew Python scripts
for splitting voices, fixing lyrics and screen-recording practice videos, and then
the web app that ties them together. That history is in `git log`.
