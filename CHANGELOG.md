# Changelog

What changed, newest first. The project has no version numbers; changes are
grouped by the day they were merged, and each line names its pull request
(`#123`) on GitHub. Changes that only touch tests, measurements or the notes for
developers are listed under *Behind the scenes*.

## Unreleased

- Practice videos: a fermata now holds about one beat longer than written instead
  of three times its length, which kept a held dotted half going for six seconds
  (Jumalan kunnia luonnossa). Render a song again to get it; no re-clean needed. (#380)
- Fix: a volta bracket or repeat sign the scan invented can now be taken out from
  `fixes.json` (`unvolta`, `unrepeat`), a "2." ending can span more than one bar,
  and a silent bar can be given its printed length (`barlen`). Suomalainen rukous,
  whose scan copied the organ's 1st ending onto an extra bar, renders again. (#378)
- Practice videos no longer race through the opening of a song that starts on a
  short pickup. The pickup bar also holds the clef, key and time signature, so the
  even-spacing step read it as far too wide and stretched the next bars to match:
  Kesäaamu's first ten bars came out up to nine times their width. Bars are now
  measured by the distance the scroll actually covers, and a bar shorter than a
  beat is compared as if it lasted a beat. Other songs' second and third bars stop being
  widened a little for the same reason. (#376)
- Record: a song whose scan left the "2." ending as an open bracket renders
  again. The scrolling video refused it as out of sync (Kristallen den fina,
  Kun poijat ne raitilla); it now follows the repeat and skips the "1." ending
  the way MuseScore plays it. (#375)
- The Upload stage lists which of a song's videos are on YouTube, and a **Free
  space** button deletes the local copies (about 150 MB a voice) once YouTube
  confirms it has every one. The links stay; recording again makes the videos
  back. A song counts as uploaded only when every video is. (#371)
- Song videos and their audio can live on another disk: `MEDIA_ROOT` in `.env`
  puts each song's media in `$MEDIA_ROOT/<song>/` instead of `songs/<song>/media/`,
  and `scripts/move_media.py` moves what is already there, checking every copied
  file before deleting the old one and leaving a song alone while it records or
  uploads. Unset, nothing changes. (#370)
- Fix panel: a bar a recorded fix in `fixes.json` already wrote is no longer offered
  as an a/b/c reading; it shows as "answered by fixes.json" with the reason. The
  remaining choices name the bar and part, box that bar on the page picture, say when
  an option is the line another part has now, and warn when `fixes.json` already
  changes that bar. (#368)
- `fixes.json`'s `delete` can now take an arpeggio sign off a chord, for a
  printed sharp the scan read as one (Trinklied B1 bar 25). (#366)
- The cleaned score is drawn the way the page prints it: rests the scan hid
  because two voices shared them now show on each part's own staff, a double or
  final barline reaches every staff, a bar's last rest no longer looks like a bar of
  its own, and after a `delbar` the system pictures start on the right bar again.
  Already-cleaned songs are drawn right without cleaning again. (#354)
- `fixes.json` can now take one note off a chord or put one on (`dropnote`,
  `addnote`). A note the page prints in brackets as optional was read as a real
  chord note, so the practice track sang both; the track now sings the main note.
  Kauan, Love Me Tender and Minä laulan sun iltasi tähtihin have their bracketed bass
  notes taken off this way. (#358)
- Writing fixes is harder to get wrong: the bar reader now shows ties, where each
  chord sits among the rests, and the bar as a fix meets it when MuseScore reset it;
  added notes are spelt with flats in a flat key; and two songs cleaning at once no
  longer fail with the bare error "3". (#357)
- `fixes.json` can now take a mark the scan invented off a chord (`delete`): a
  fermata, an articulation, a breath mark, a staff text, a tempo or a rehearsal
  mark. Mieslaulu bar 13's fermatas, where the page prints staccato dots, can now
  be recorded away. The Fix panel's bar reading lists each chord's marks. (#352)
- The "This parse looks unusable" warning is gone from Review, Fix and the clean's
  log. On scanned songs it was set off mostly by homr's `⚠` questions, so it called
  scores whose notes were right unusable; the issue count and the Fix rows stay. (#356)
- `fixes.json` can now take off a time signature the scan invented, or write
  another of the same bar length in its place (`timesig`), on every staff. Kesäaamu's
  stray 3/4 at bar 22 is recorded this way. Health also stops flagging a song's last
  bar when it completes the opening pickup. (#353)
- A `bar` fix can now give a voice the scan made too long a bar that fills the
  time signature. False triplets had left Lasinkuultava laulu's T1 bar 9 7/6 long
  in 4/4, a length no writable bar adds up to, so MuseScore reset it to a rest and
  no recorded fix could put it back. (#350)
- `fixes.json` can now take out a bar the scan invented, on every staff (`delbar`):
  a volta or slur across it is shortened to match, and fixes after it in the file
  count bars without it. `insbar` puts in an empty bar where the scan lost a
  barline, for `bar` fixes to fill. (#346)
- A bar a recorded fix has answered stops showing red. An `unmark` or a pick now
  finds the bar's red mark on either part of a shared staff (the mark sits on the
  first part, the red notes on both), a `tie`/`untie`, `slur`/`unslur` or `duration`
  answers the mark's `tie?`, `slur?` or `rhythm?`, and once no mark is left on the
  bar its red notes turn black. Cleaning no longer copies each red mark into
  `fixes.json`, and the next clean removes the copies already there. (#347)
- A `duration` fix that gives a bar its time signature back now also takes out the
  back-step cleaning had squeezed the other voices into the short bar with, so those
  voices are no longer reset to rests by the MuseScore check. Gute Nacht bar 6 and
  Annin laulu bars 9, 10 and 21 now come out right from `fixes.json` alone. A `bar`
  fix also writes over a gap cleaning left in a voice instead of refusing it, so
  Integer vitae T2 bar 9 and Jouluyö's last bar can be recorded too. (#344)
- `fixes.json` can now take out a tie (`untie`), for the dashed ties a strophic song
  prints for a later verse only, which the scan reads as real ties. (#343)
- `fixes.json` can now take out a slur (`unslur`), tie two notes (`tie`) and give
  a note another length, double dots included (`duration`); a length change that
  makes the bar fit its time signature again gives the bar that length on every
  staff. A bar rewrite now also cuts a slur whose other half is in another bar. The
  Fix stage's bar reply now carries the bar's `from` tokens with its rests, and the
  lyric import's reply lists its mismatches. (#340)
- The Upload stage lists the choir's playlists with a tick box each, read from
  YouTube: ticking puts every video of the song into that playlist and unticking
  takes them out, so a song no longer has to be re-uploaded to change its
  playlists. "Add another playlist…" offers the account's other playlists, and the
  playlist menus no longer list every song's own playlist. (#338)
- Importing lyrics no longer throws the Lyrics panel back to the top: the list
  stays where it was, the box being typed in keeps its focus, and the warnings
  change in place. The One system view shows the cleaned system with its words
  under the printed one, and after an import only the systems whose words changed
  are drawn again, the old picture staying until the new one is ready. Compare
  does the same. (#337)
- In per-system cleaning, a chord with more notes than part names no longer loses
  the extra notes: the lowest named part keeps them as its chord, and the Clean grid
  and the Fix stage no longer warn about it. (#330)
- In per-system cleaning, a staff carrying two lines with only one part name
  (usually a name carried over from an earlier system) no longer loses its lower
  line in silence: the Clean grid marks the cell and asks before cleaning, and the
  Fix stage lists every line left without a part of its own until it is named.
  (#332)
- Answering a problem in the Fix stage no longer throws the list to its bottom:
  the next card moves up into the place of the one answered. (#331)
- It also stays put when the panel refreshes again a moment after the tap, which
  it does about half the time, and as the page crops above it finish loading.
  (#329)
- A problem card in the Fix stage also says which staff of the printed system the
  part is on, and which voice of that staff ("Bar 3 of 7 · staff 2 of 4, only
  voice"). A per-system song shows it after its next clean. (#310)
- homr's other readings of an unsure bar are offered only on a part printed on
  the staff homr read, so the same notes an octave away on another singer's staff
  no longer pick up the choices. (#310)
- When a repeat ends, the Fix stage asks whether the page prints "1." and "2."
  brackets there and how many bars the "1." covers, with one tap per length. homr
  does not read the brackets, and without them the practice track played the "1."
  bars on both passes. (#319)
- Each part video uploaded to YouTube says in its description which staff the part
  is sung from (`stemmanauha-staff: 2/5`), so the practice site can zoom a phone to
  the right staff even when two parts share one. `backfill_staff_lines.py` adds the
  line to videos uploaded before this. (#323)
- After a YouTube upload, or deleting the uploaded videos, the app asks the
  stemmanauhat site to refresh its video list straight away, so a new song shows
  there within minutes instead of hours. Needs `STEMMANAUHAT_DISPATCH_TOKEN` in
  `.env`. (#321)
- Scrolling videos follow D.C. and D.S. jumps (al Fine, al Coda) instead of refusing
  the score: the bars play in MuseScore's order and the scroll jumps back to the
  segno or the start and forward to the coda. (#314)
- A slur or tie that runs over a line break is kept when the scan joins the
  systems, instead of being lost. When only one half of a slur was read, or the
  next line prints a different number of staves, the note is marked `⚠ slur?` to
  check against the page. Needs a homr that keeps slur ends at the system edge.
  (#318)
- A scrolling video whose repeat jumps back across a time-signature change
  (a 7/4 bar repeating to a 4/4 one where a part rests) renders in time instead
  of being refused as out of sync. (#313)
- A start-repeat sign homr read on only some staves of a printed system is now kept:
  it used to vanish from the score, so the practice track repeated the wrong bars.
  When a repeat ends and the scan found no start for it, the Fix stage asks where
  the page prints the start, with one tap per printed system. (#316)
- A problem card in the Fix stage says which bar of the printed line it is
  about ("Bar 2 of 4 in this line"), so the bar no longer has to be counted off
  the picture. (#311)
- When a lyric line has more syllables than notes, every note still gets its own
  syllable and only the extra ones go on the last note; extra `_` are dropped. It
  used to pile the whole bar onto its first note. (#308)
- The Fix stage lists every problem once, one card per bar and part, with its
  choices beside the page: homr's other lengths for an unsure bar, homr's other
  pitches for an unsure note, and for a slur the scan ran between two singers, the
  slur in either, both or neither. One tap applies the answer and keeps it for the
  next clean. (#290)
- An unsure bar's choices are now whole bars, lengths and pitches already put
  together, so picking one never undoes another. homr's second reading of the bar
  (the one behind a `notes?` mark) is always one of them, labelled "second
  reading". Six show first and the rest are behind "More". (#295)

## 2026-10-07

- The score viewer says when it is waiting: a score being built shows a running
  count, a rebuilt one keeps the old picture under "Updating…", and a failed build
  says why. In Compare and Scan vs page the engraved systems wait in their place
  and arrive top to bottom instead of popping in at random. (#303)
- The Record panel's Preview button now saves every setting (tempo, quality,
  margins, shared staves, NVIDIA encoding) and starts drawing the preview at once,
  with a progress bar and a seconds counter. A new Save settings button saves them
  without previewing. (#302)
- Re-cleaning no longer fails after the per-system grid is answered again. A
  reading picked in the Fix panel now follows its notes to whichever part they
  land in, and is dropped (with a line in the log) if no part sings them any
  more. (#292)
- In the per-system grid, a part named like `S1b` now sings `S1`'s notes (and
  words) in every bar where it has none of its own, instead of resting. (#293)
- A bar a part rests through shows its rest in the middle of the bar after cleaning,
  as MuseScore draws a bar rest, instead of at the start of the bar. (#298)

## 2026-10-06

- A scanned song moves on to Clean as soon as every system is read; there is no
  longer a "This reading is right" button to press. Reading a system again no
  longer sends a song that is further along back to Scan. (#282)
- Cleaning no longer ties notes the page prints separately. A tie was copied from
  another voice whenever it held the same pitch on the same beats; now that voice
  must also sing the same rhythm, so a repeated figure under a held note keeps its
  notes (and its syllables). (#284)
- The health check no longer counts a grace note's length into its bar, so a bar
  with grace notes is not reported as overfull. (#283)
- A warning on a scanned bar is one short word ("⚠ accidental?"), and the note it is
  about is red, so the spot is easy to find in MuseScore. A red note left behind is
  played black in the practice video. (#280)
- A scanned song marks the first bar of a system for checking when a note the
  previous system ended with a printed accidental starts it again without one: a
  note tied over the line break keeps its accidental, and the scan cannot tell.
  (#279)
- A scanned song no longer shows a meter change at every system break when the
  page prints its meter once and carries it (2/2 read back as 4/4). (#277)
- A meter change printed at the start of a system is kept even when the new bars
  are the same length as the old ones (2/2 to 4/4). (#278)

## 2026-10-05

- Scanning a PDF whose pages are stored sideways and turned upright now reads each
  printed system instead of the bottom of one and the top of the next. (#273)
- When homr is unsure how long a bar's notes are, the Fix stage shows its likeliest
  readings drawn under the page; tap the one the page prints and it goes onto the
  score and survives a re-clean. Needs an updated homr (Install / Update homr).
  (#271)
- Scanning marks in red every bar homr is probably wrong about, so it gets checked
  against the page; a scan takes twice as long for it. (#270)
- Per-system cleaning no longer leaves tenors read off a plain treble staff an
  octave too high, and scanned songs no longer share one set of grid answers. (#266)

## 2026-10-04

- The README is now about the web app, with screenshots; the command-line tools
  and MuseScore plugins moved to TOOLS.md, and this changelog was added. (#264)
- On a phone, the stage list moves into a ☰ drawer, the bottom bar stays on
  screen, and the score zooms itself (pinch, or − / + / Fit). (#263)
- The homr install box moved from the Library page to the Scan panel, where homr
  is used. (#262)
- The header has an always-visible **Reload** button. (#259)
- Page images cut from a PDF follow the PDF they came from, so a replaced PDF is
  not shown with old pictures. (#256)
- A health re-check started by the file watcher no longer overwrites a lyric import
  that saved at the same moment. (#254)
- Lyric slots: a slur that starts on a tied-into note, or on a slur end, still
  takes a syllable. (#253)
- **Install or update homr from the Library page**, with its log shown while it
  runs; scans wait while it installs. (#250)
- Scrolling video: **two parts can share a staff** in the picture (the Record
  panel's *Shared staves*). (#248)
- Scanned songs label their printed systems with their bar numbers. (#244)
- New song: leaving the name blank uses the file's own name. (#242)
- Clean takes out slurs that jump from one singer to another and bars longer than
  their time signature, and marks each changed bar in red until a person deletes
  the mark. (#239)
- Clean gives both voices a rest the page prints once for the two of them, and
  resets bars MuseScore 3 would call corrupted; the Review stage says whether the
  file opens in MuseScore. (#237)
- **Find systems** reads the page itself in under a second, without homr; *Ask
  homr* is still there when homr is installed. (#236)
- Scan panel: read every system again with one press. (#232)
- Scanning follows the newest homr: its own note positions are ignored and the
  title is not read. (#224)
- The app's own copies of slur repair and system finding were removed; homr does
  both now. (#222)
- Behind the scenes: kept the app's own system cropping after measuring homr's
  (#226); added Talviuni to the reviewed reference songs (#229, #233); developer
  notes (#218, #228).

## 2026-09-22

- **Download the cleaned score and upload a fixed one back**, so a score can be
  fixed in MuseScore on another computer or from a phone. (#217)
- Behind the scenes: corrected a measurement claim in the developer notes. (#215)

## 2026-09-12

- Find systems uses homr's supported printed-system command. (#214)

## 2026-09-06

- Every scanned system records which homr read it, and the Scan panel shows it.
  (#159)
- A whole-bar rest that shares a voice with notes is moved to a voice of its own,
  and the move is written into the Fix list for a person to check. (#165)
- Review and Fix say outright when a scan is too damaged to be worth repairing,
  instead of only counting problems. (#171)
- Scanned systems keep each note on the beat homr read it on. (#180)
- The time signature of a scanned score is worked out from the bars, since homr
  can only guess the top number. (#184)
- A singer keeps their part across the join between two scanned systems. (#189)
- Behind the scenes: measurements and corrections to them (#163, #194, #198, #199,
  #201), and where an OMR fix belongs (#176).

## 2026-09-05

- Behind the scenes: wrote down which repository an OMR fix belongs in. (#143)

## 2026-09-04

- A scanned band gets only the staves its own system prints. (#140)
- Notation such as clefs and keys carries across joined systems. (#139)
- Behind the scenes: judge a scan against songs the choir has already sung. (#138)

## 2026-09-03

- A system that was read again can be seen again in the comparison. (#136)
- Behind the scenes: recorded where homr runs fastest on this host. (#137)

## 2026-09-02

- **A song can be started from its PDF alone.** (#128)
- A system that read fine can be read again. (#132)
- Run a homr branch from a local checkout, chosen per scan, and name exactly which
  homr each choice is. (#131, #133, #134)
- The app proposes the printed-system bands instead of only letting you draw
  them. (#135)

## 2026-09-01

- **The Scan stage**: read a score off its PDF one printed system at a time with
  homr, see each system next to the page, and approve the result. (#108, #109,
  #111, #119, #121)
- Slurs homr invented are dropped. (#114)
- A score where most bars set their own length gets one health finding that
  counts the odd bars, instead of none. (#126)
- The by-system lyric editor keeps empty slots. (#89)
- **Record a missing slur from the Fix panel.** (#90)
- System crops follow the score they came from. (#91)
- The video render waits its turn behind other heavy jobs on the host. (#102)
- Behind the scenes: committed public-domain benchmark pages. (#120)

## 2026-08-30

- The video numbers the bar at the start of each printed system, not every bar.
  (#79)

## 2026-08-28

- On a phone, the bottom bar stays clear of the browser's toolbar. (#55)

## 2026-08-26

- The scroll preview can play **synchronized audio**, off until asked for.
  (#67, #70)
- Redesigned Review and Record for phones; the preview moved into the viewer.
  (#68)
- Videos render much faster: each tile is drawn from only the music it shows.
  (#71)
- Bar widths in the video change gradually, so the scroll does not lurch. (#73)
- The video's bottom margin starts at 5%, and the framing chosen in a preview is
  remembered. (#75, #76)
- A lit notehead keeps a clean edge. (#65)
- Behind the scenes: the full test suite is left to CI. (#77)

## 2026-08-25

- **Preview the scrolling video in the browser before rendering**, using the
  render's own pixels. (#61, #62)
- Video margins are adjustable. (#50)
- The note in a tempo mark ("♩ = 80") is drawn instead of showing as a box. (#59)
- A recorded fix can be a plain sentence. (#57)
- A word split by a barline stays one word. (#45)
- **Installable on a phone's home screen** (PWA). (#41, #43)
- Songs link to AgentDeck chats, and the button says why it cannot act when it
  cannot. (#51, #53)
- Rendering refreshes, audio progress and reload state are clearer. (#39)
- Behind the scenes: CI on every pull request (#36); the live app's address
  (#44); glyph alignment check (#49).

## 2026-08-24

- The browser no longer serves stale app code or old videos. (#35)
- Render progress is shown, and 4K renders are faster. (#27)
- Choose a tempo when the score has none. (#30)
- Scrolling video: a beat marker, rests highlighted, and whole-bar rests no longer
  pull the focus. (#12, #25, #32)
- A song's recorded fixes are applied every time it is cleaned. (#10)
- A **New issue** button in the header. (#24)
- The PDF viewer scrolls on a phone. (#16)
- Clearer lyric hyphen guidance. (#33)
- Behind the scenes: reliable test suite (#14), easier pipeline checks (#18),
  agent worktrees no longer block the deploy (#19), a background-render fix (#21).

## 2026-08-23

- **Scrolling practice videos rendered from the score**, now the Record stage's
  default. (#7)
- Per-system scores are repaired like any other, and two singers written as one
  chord are split. (#9)
- Lyric import returns its warnings as data the app can point at. (#5)
- The per-system grid understands `-` (this staff is silent from here). (#4)
- Behind the scenes: per-system answers behind one interface (#3); a browser test
  for clean → lyrics (#6); new-machine setup notes (#8).

## Before August 2026

The project started in 2020 as a set of MuseScore 3 plugins (`export.qml`,
`voice2.qml`, lyric copy and replace, the rest-track spacer), grew Python scripts
for splitting voices, fixing lyrics and screen-recording practice videos, and then
the web app that ties them together. That history is in `git log`.
