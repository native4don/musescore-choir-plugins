# Install homr (optical music recognition) into a venv the song app can call.
#
# homr does not go into the app's own .venv on purpose. The unattended deploy
# reinstalls pip-requirements.txt on every merge, and homr is ~660 MB of
# onnxruntime/opencv wheels plus ~150 MB of model weights that it stores inside
# its own site-packages — so a reinstall there would churn the weights and a
# resolution failure would take the live app down. It lives in its own venv,
# outside the checkout, so a fresh clone or a deploy never touches it.
#
# Idempotent: re-running upgrades homr in place and re-downloads only whatever
# weights are missing.

#
# The song app's Library page runs this same script behind its Install / Update
# homr button (src/song_app/homr_install.py), so a phone can update homr too.
#
# This is the ONLY install. A branch of the fork is not installed at all: the
# app runs a local working copy of it straight from source, borrowing this
# venv's dependencies (see src/song_app/omr.py, "engines"). Editing a branch and
# reading a page again is then a loop with no install in it.
#
# Afterwards, point the app at it if you used a non-default location:
#   HOMR_BIN=/somewhere/else/bin/homr   in .env

# Where homr comes from. ONE PLACE, deliberately. It used to be the immutable
# v0.7.0 commit; it now follows the fork's `main`, which is upstream's own tip.
# The trade is deliberate and worth naming: an install is no longer reproducible
# from this file alone — two hosts set up a month apart get different OMR, and
# so does one host reinstalled — in exchange for picking up upstream's fixes
# without a commit hash to move by hand each time. Nothing installs this
# automatically (the deploy never touches the homr venv), so the day it changes
# is a day somebody ran this script, and running it is when the frozen benchmark
# should be run again. An explicit HOMR_SOURCE still overrides it: pass a commit
# to get an old parse back.
#
# The [cpu] extra is now load-bearing and was not on 0.7.0: upstream has moved
# onnxruntime out of the base dependencies into cpu/cuda/rocm extras, so a plain
# install of `main` produces a homr with no inference runtime at all. It fails at
# the first parse, not at install time. CPU is the only one this host can use
# (issue #93: the GTX 970 is sm_52, below onnxruntime's sm_60 floor).
