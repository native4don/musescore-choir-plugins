"""The same render, as pictures a browser can scroll instead of a file ffmpeg must write.

Looking at a scrolling video is how anyone finds out whether the picture is right:
the margins, the staff size, where the beat marker sits, whether a repeat lands
back on the right bar. Finding that out cost a full render — minutes of engraving,
rasterising, encoding and audio — for a question about layout.

So this stops one step short of the encoder. `build.prepare` decides the render and
`build.raster` draws it, both exactly as `build_videos` does, only at a height a web
page can carry; what comes back is that drawing as PNG tiles plus the numbers the
player needs. **The pixels are the renderer's own.** An earlier version sent the
engraving as SVG and let the browser draw it, which was cheaper and looked wrong in
a way nobody could act on: verovio writes lyrics and measure numbers as
`font-family="Times, serif"`, cairosvg resolves that against this host's fonts and a
browser against its own, so the words in the preview were never the words in the
video. Handing over pixels ends that whole class of difference — a preview is now
the video's own frames, at a smaller size and without the sound.

What the browser is left to do is interpolate the scroll curve, copy the window out
of the strip, and copy each sounding symbol's box out of a second, pre-lit strip. It
works out nothing about music, layout, time or colour.
