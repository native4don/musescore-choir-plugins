"""Widening the bars that scroll too fast, and only those.

Verovio spaces a measure by what is *in* it: a bar of sixteenths with lyrics
under every note comes out far wider per beat than a bar of two half notes. Since
the scroll follows the notes, the video then speeds up and slows down with the
engraving, and on this repertoire that reaches a 5x step between one bar and the
next.

Two numbers describe a bar: how wide verovio drew it, and how long it lasts.
Their ratio — width per quarter note — *is* the speed the video scrolls through
that bar, which is why the rule is written on the ratio and not on raw width: a
3/4 bar beside a 4/4 one is narrower and should be. What a singer notices is not
a wide bar but a **step** in that speed, so what this module caps is the ratio
between neighbours, and the job is to find the narrowest score that keeps it.

That has a closed form. The smallest widths-per-beat ``x_i >= natural_i`` with
``x_i / x_j <= cap`` for neighbours are ``x_i = max_j natural_j / cap**|i - j|``:
every bar is pulled up by whichever other bar reaches furthest, and the pull dies
away geometrically, so one dense bar widens the few bars around it and the far end
of the song not at all. Being the smallest bar by bar, it is also the smallest in
total — there is no shorter strip that satisfies the cap.

Reaching a target is the trick `add_rest_track.qml` already used inside MuseScore:
a hidden staff of rests, injected into the MusicXML after MuseScore has produced it
— so it never reaches the MIDI or the audio — and cropped back off the bottom of
the rendered strip. What is new here is that the number of rests is chosen **per
bar** rather than as one grid over the whole song, and that a score already inside
the cap gets no spacer staff at all.

How wide a bar goes for a given number of rests is not something to work out in
advance. Verovio gives each separate moment in a bar a minimum width, so rests
laid on moments the music already has change nothing, and past that point what one
more is worth falls away as the bar fills up — about a fifth as much in a bar of
32nds as in a bar of quarters. So this measures instead: engrave, read the bars
back, work out from that engraving what a rest was worth in each bar, solve again,
and stop when solving twice running gives the same answer. Three or four engravings
of a score that needs widening, one for a score that does not.

Two things were got wrong here and are worth not repeating. The rests have to be
written as **real note values** — verovio reads what a rest is written as and not
its `<duration>`, so a rest of "one fifth of a bar" is taken for a whole rest and
quietly drags the whole part out of time with the audio, with nothing wrong in the
picture to show it. And the targets are settled **before** any rest is written and
never moved again: re-solving the cap against the widths a plan produced looks like
the way to tidy away the last few percent of rounding, and instead it walks
outwards bar by bar and inflates the entire score.

    Returns the engraving and whether a spacer staff is on the page (and so has to
    be cropped off the bottom). A score already inside the cap comes back engraved
    exactly as verovio drew it: no spacer staff, no added width, and the same page
    it would have had before any of this existed.

    Otherwise it alternates between arithmetic and engraving. `solve_plan` works out
    a whole plan from what a rest is currently believed to be worth; engraving it
    says what a rest was really worth; the plan is solved again with that in hand.
    The first round guesses, the second knows, and it stops as soon as solving twice
    running gives the same answer.
