"""When each note sounds — on MuseScore's clock, not verovio's.

Verovio's timemap ignores MuseScore playback properties, above all the
``timeStretch=3`` that `clean_score` puts on fermatas: on the Hanget soi fixture
verovio says 48.0s where MuseScore renders 59.6s. MuseScore writes that stretch
into its MIDI export as tempo changes (120 -> 40 bpm for a fermata), so the MIDI
tempo map is the same clock the audio is rendered on.

So: musical position (quarter notes) comes from verovio, seconds come from the
MIDI tempo map, and audio and video cannot drift.

    The engraving decides where a note sits, so following note positions exactly
    makes the scroll speed track how densely each measure happens to be engraved.
    Averaging over a couple of seconds removes that jitter while keeping the curve
    anchored to the music: on the Käyttäytymisohjeita fixture it takes the speed's
    coefficient of variation from 0.30 to 0.15 while the sung note moves less than
    2% of a screen. Scrolling at a dead constant speed would instead drift by
    nearly half a screen, which is why this smooths rather than straightens.

    It is the **speed** that is averaged, and the result integrated back into
    positions. Averaging positions directly would flatten the curve at both ends
    (the pad has no slope to continue), so a perfectly even scroll would come out
    ramping up at the start and down at the finish.

    Repeats stay sharp: a jump back to a repeated section is real motion, and each
    stretch between jumps is smoothed on its own. Jumps are found in the anchors,
    before resampling smears them across frames. `cuts` names further places to
    start a stretch (seconds, from `cut_anchors`): a jump forward to a coda is as
    real as one back to a repeat, but no size of step says so.
