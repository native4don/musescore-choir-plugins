"""Following a D.C./D.S. jump in MuseScore's played order.

The first half is the rebuild on hand-written timemaps, so each rule is pinned
without MuseScore. The second half is the property that matters, on two small
committed scores: every highlight lands on a note MuseScore actually plays, and
the scroll lands at each jump instead of sweeping across the page.
