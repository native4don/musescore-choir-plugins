"""The browser preview is the render, minus the encoder.

Every test here is a way of asking the same question: could what a singer sees in
the browser differ from what comes out of the encoder? The preview is only worth
having if the answer stays no, so these pin it to `build.prepare` and `build.raster`
— the clock, the scroll curve, the viewport, the symbols that light up, the pixels
themselves, and the refusals — rather than to what the payload happens to contain.

The pixel tests are the point of the payload's present shape. While the browser was
given the engraving as SVG and left to draw it, no test could have caught the thing
that was actually wrong: verovio writes lyrics and measure numbers as
`font-family="Times, serif"`, and a browser and cairosvg do not choose the same
serif. `test_the_strip_is_the_renderers_own_pixels` is what closes that door.
