"""Run the MuseScore command line, and decide whether it worked.

Every place this project asks MuseScore for a file used to decide for itself, and
they all decided the same way: exit code 0 and the file is there, otherwise the
step failed. MuseScore 4 breaks that rule without breaking the work. Measured on
MuseScore Studio 4.7.5, macOS 26 (October 2026): the export is written, complete
and usable, and the process then dies while shutting down --

    libc++abi: terminating due to uncaught exception of type
    std::__1::system_error: mutex lock failed: Invalid argument

-- which Python reports as return code -6 (SIGABRT) and a shell as 134. It is not
occasional: in one test run it hit nearly every export. Treated as a failure, it
fails Record, the previews and the conversions, all with their files sitting on
disk.

So the decision lives here, once, and it is deliberately narrow:

* Exit 0 and the file exists: success. Unchanged.
* **That** crash -- an abort, carrying that message -- after a file that was
  **written during this run** and is **complete for its kind**: success, and it is
  said out loud. A step that quietly succeeded past a crash is how a real failure
  gets missed later.
* Anything else is failure: the crash with no file, with a file cut short, or with
  only an older file left where the new one should be; an abort without that
  message; any other non-zero exit, file or no file.

"Written during this run" is not a nicety. A leftover file from an earlier run is
complete and well-formed, and accepting it would hand back the previous result as
if it were the new one -- `pipeline.scan_system_render` records exactly that
happening with an old picture. The file's size and modification time are noted
before MuseScore starts and compared afterwards.
