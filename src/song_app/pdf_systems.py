"""Crop a score PDF into one image per printed system.

The original PDF is the only place some things exist -- lyrics the OCR dropped,
slurs it lost, what an over-full measure was meant to be. Read as whole pages it
is close to useless: a full A4 rendered small enough to look at is far too coarse
to see a slur or count noteheads. Cropped per system at 400 dpi it is legible.

**Where the system boundaries come from is not decided here.** An AI reads the
pages and proposes them; a person corrects them in the app; this module renders,
crops, stores and labels. Deciding where a system starts turned out to be a poor
fit for image heuristics -- staff-line detection died at 1 degree of skew and at
20% ink dropout, and grouping staves into systems depended on a bracket that only
some editions print -- so the judgement belongs to whoever is looking at the page.

`page_images(..., grid=True)` draws a labelled percentage scale down the margin so
boundaries can be read off a ruler rather than estimated by eye. Bounds are stored
as fractions of page height, so they survive a change of resolution.

One module, two consumers: the web app draws the boundaries over the page and lets
them be dragged, and an agent reads the same crops off disk.
