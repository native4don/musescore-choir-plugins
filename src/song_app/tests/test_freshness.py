"""What the browser is told about how long it may keep a file.

The app deploys over itself every couple of minutes and a re-recorded part is
written back under the same name, so "the phone shows the old one" is a bug that
happens on an ordinary day. Nothing here checks that a file is *never* cached —
that would throw away the 304s that make the app usable on a phone. It checks
that the browser is made to ask.
