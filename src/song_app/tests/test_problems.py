"""Every problem in one list, each with its choices (#290).

What the Fix panel shows is built here, so this pins what a row is: one per bar and
part, everything wrong there said once, homr's other readings offered beside it as
whole bars — lengths and pitches together, and the second reading (#295) — and a slur the scan ran between two singers offered back in either, both or
neither. Then the answers: each goes onto the score and into fixes.json, and the slur
answer comes back on a re-clean.
