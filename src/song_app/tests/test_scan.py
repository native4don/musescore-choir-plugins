"""The scan stage: the orchestration, the holes, and the one invalidation rule.

Nothing here runs homr or poppler. Cropping and reading are the two things this
module does not own -- :mod:`omr_systems` owns reading and #103 pinned it -- so
they are stubbed, and what is left under test is exactly what this stage adds:
which bands are cropped and how wide, what happens when one of them cannot be
read, and what stops being true when an input moves.

Flattening and assembling are *not* stubbed. They are cheap, they need no binary,
and stubbing them would leave the seam between a fragment on disk and an
assembled score untested, which is where a hole would go unnoticed.
