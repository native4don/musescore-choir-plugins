"""Reading a score one printed system at a time.

Two halves, and they are tested differently. **Flattening** is about what homr
emits: a part is not a part, it is one or two staves wearing a name that means
nothing, and the tests here are little documents in the shapes homr actually
produced on the benchmark -- four one-staff "Voice" parts, two two-staff
"Piano" parts, and a mixture of the two. **Assembling** is about the seams that
only exist because each crop is its own document: bar 1 five times over, a
different ``divisions`` each time, and a key and time signature re-declared at
every join.

The last test is the one that matters and the only one that needs MuseScore: a
score assembled from systems of two, three and two staves, converted and handed
to ``clean_score``'s per-system machinery, has to come back as those systems
with those staves. That is the whole point -- the app assembles, and the grid
asks a person which staff is which part.

No test here runs homr. Whether it can read music is homr's business, and the
card's own acceptance ran on the frozen benchmark, which is host state.
