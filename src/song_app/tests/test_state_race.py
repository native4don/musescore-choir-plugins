"""The file watcher must not put back a song state it loaded before a route saved.

On 2026-10-04 a lyric import on Ketun joululaulu answered `stage: review` with its
`lyrics` record, and moments later `.song.json` had neither (#252). The import
rewrites the cleaned score in place, which wakes the watcher; the watcher loaded the
song before the import saved, checked the score's health, and saved the whole copy
it had loaded — after the import. Nothing said the import had been undone.

These drive that interleaving on purpose rather than hoping a thread loses a race.
