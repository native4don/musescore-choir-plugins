"""The scan stage: read a score off its PDF, one printed system at a time.

:mod:`omr_systems` can read a band and put the bands back together. Nothing
called it. This module is what the app calls: it takes a song that has a PDF and
printed-system bounds, and leaves behind an input score the rest of the app
already knows what to do with.

**A band is padded before it is cropped.** Issue #112 measured it: B5's second
system cropped exactly on its printed bounds came back as 2 parts, and padded by
60px it came back as 3 -- the staves the page prints -- with the same bars, the
same notes and the same slurs. Tightening the same crop by 40-60px instead lost
five slur tokens, because a slur's arc hangs below the staff it belongs to and a
tight edge cuts it off. Padding cost nothing on that page, so the band is given
:data:`PAD` of the page's height at each edge. It is a fraction rather than
pixels for the reason bounds themselves are: it has to mean the same thing at
whatever resolution the crop is taken.

**A failed system is a hole, not a failed song.** Twenty homr runs is twenty
chances to fail, and losing the nineteenth should not throw away the eighteen
that worked. So a band that cannot be read is recorded as a hole and the loop
carries on to the next one; the fragments already read stay on disk, and a later
run reads only what is missing. The song cannot leave ``scan`` while a hole is
open, because a score silently missing one of its systems is the failure this
whole approach exists to avoid.

That includes a **lost lease**. :mod:`heavy_slot` stops work whose slot was
handed to somebody else, and each band takes its own slot, so a lease lost during
band 7 costs band 7 and nothing else -- band 8 asks for a fresh slot of its own,
which is a request that queues behind whoever the cores went to rather than
competing with them.

**A fragment says which homr read it, and that record invalidates nothing.**
This pull request proposes it (#154, #157). The identity goes into the MusicXML
itself as well as into the song's state, because a fragment is routinely read
straight off disk by something that never opens the app — that is exactly how
#129 came to spend a session diagnosing a defect that had already been fixed.
It is provenance and not a stamp: :func:`content_stamp` steps over it, so
upgrading homr discards no fragment, drops no grid answer and takes away no
reviewer's approval. Re-reading stays what it already is, a person pressing a
button. Fragments read before this read as **unknown**, which is the true value
rather than a gap.

**A bar the boundary straightened is written down for a person to read.**
:func:`omr.split_measure_rests` moves a whole-measure rest homr put in a sung
voice, and :func:`_record_repairs` puts one ``text`` entry per move into the
song's ``fixes.json``, which the Fix panel lists as outstanding. Both halves or
neither: cleaning pads what the repair leaves behind, health then goes quiet,
and a loudly wrong bar becomes a quietly wrong one — this project's named
failure mode, occurring inside a repair.

**Everything here is derived, and derived things go stale.** The fragments are
derived from the bands, the grid answers from the fragments, the input score from
the fragments, and the reviewer's approval from all of it. When an input changes,
everything downstream of it stops being true -- see :func:`reconcile`, which is
the only place that idea is written down.

**A finished scan moves the song on to Clean by itself** (#281). It used to wait
for a person to say the whole reading was right (#99, #116), on the argument that
the dangerous parse is the tidy one. That check could not really be made on this
screen, so in practice it was pressed without looking, and a re-read sent songs
that were already cleaned and lyricked back to ``scan``. The tidy-but-wrong parse
is now caught later and bar by bar: homr's ``⚠`` doubt marks, the Fix panel's
other readings of an unsure bar, the health findings, and Review's approval -- the
one approval left, which still lapses when a re-read changes a system. Only a
hole keeps or puts a song back on ``scan``, because a score missing a system must
not be cleaned.
