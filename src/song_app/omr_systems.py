"""Read a score one printed system at a time, and put the systems back together.

The whole-page route asks homr a question it cannot answer. Given a page, homr
assembles a part by taking staff index N out of *every* system it found, which
assumes the score is a rectangle -- the same staves, in the same order, in every
system. Choral engraving is not a rectangle: a part that rests through a system
is simply not printed, so a page really can be 2-3-2-3-3 staves. When the counts
disagree homr first deletes an edge system and then, failing that, breaks every
group into singletons, which is how B5 -- four vocal staves -- came out of a
whole-page scan as one monophonic line of 70 bars (issue #105).

Given **one system**, there is nothing to reconcile. The assumption becomes
vacuous rather than wrong. Measured on B5's three systems, cropped:

    system 1   4 staves found, grouped [4]   -> 4 x "Voice"
    system 2   4 staves found, grouped [2]   -> 2 x "Piano", two staves each
    system 3   4 staves found, grouped [3]   -> "Voice", "Piano", "Voice"

Four staves' worth of notes every time. The grouping moves around and the part
names are fiction -- homr says "Voice" and "Piano" and means neither -- but the
notes of a fused part carry ``<staff>1</staff>`` / ``<staff>2</staff>``, so
nothing is lost. **Grand-staff fusion is a labelling detail.** Flatten every
part into its staves and the grouping stops mattering, which is why this module
ignores ``part-name`` entirely.

So the division of labour is: **homr reports, the app assembles.** What homr is
asked for is "the staves of this band, in order". What comes back out of here is
one score, systems in order, one part per staff column.

**Which voice is absent from a short system is not decided here**, because it is
not recoverable from pixels -- you need the words, the range, or the piece. The
columns are filled from the top and the empty rows are measure rests; naming
them is ``clean_score``'s ``--per-system`` grid's job, and that grid already asks
a person, which is the only reliable answer.

Issue #195 measured what that refusal costs and what it does not. Scored before
the grid is answered, the four corpus pages whose systems print different staff
counts read 28.3% against a per-system 93.5%, and 592 of the 791 faults are
`size` -- but that is the intermediate being read as if it were the product.
Answered from the reviewed score's own per-band grouping the same four pages read
**77.2%**, and every point still missing is on the two pages where a crop read
one bar more than the page prints; up to that bar assembly costs nothing. A
better guess here would also not help: of the 9 narrow systems on those pages
only 2 are a voice resting, and 7 are divisi printed apart in one system and
together in the rest, where the narrow system's first staff carries two of the
page's rows and no single row is the right answer. Those percentages were scored
by the comparator issue #196 has since replaced and were not re-scored -- **the
gap between them included**. Both sides come off one rule, which makes 28.3%
against 77.2% an honest measurement under that rule; it does not make the gap
invariant under the new one, since a different ranking can move the two sides by
different amounts. The conclusion stands as plausible and unverified until
someone re-scores both with issue #196's rule.

**Bounds are a precondition.** This module is given the printed systems; it does
not look for them. Detecting them from the image was measured and abandoned in
issue #80 (staff-line detection died at half a degree of skew, and grouping by
bracket agreed with the score twice in nine songs), so they come from
``.systems.json`` -- an AI reading ``pdf_systems.page_images(grid=True)`` and a
person correcting the bands in the Systems viewer.

**Twenty seams instead of five.** Each crop is its own document: bar numbering
restarts at 1, ``divisions`` is whatever that run chose, and key and time are
re-declared. :func:`assemble` owns all of it -- one ``divisions`` for the whole
score, continuous bar numbers, a re-declaration dropped when it says what was
already true, and a system break written at each seam so the per-system grid
sees the same systems the page has.

    Renumbering from 1 is necessary -- a voice number means nothing outside its
    part and this staff is becoming one, so a note saying ``<voice>5</voice>``
    would arrive claiming to be the fifth voice of a part that has one. But it
    has to be **one decision for the staff**, and issue #187 is what it cost to
    make it once per bar.

    Two ways a per-bar decision moved a singer. The order the notes are written
    in is homr's interleaving rather than a fact about the music, so a bar homr
    happened to write lower-voice-first swapped the two; and a bar where only
    one of the two voices sings compacted whichever singer that was down to
    voice 1. Both put every note at the right pitch on the right beat in the
    wrong part, which no health check sees -- both voices are well-formed and
    the bar adds up -- and which a singer meets as somebody else's line in their
    practice track.

    **The order is homr's own numbering** (:func:`_voice_key`), and not which
    voice sounds highest. That is a deliberate refusal to make a claim: this
    function's whole job is to stop the assembler *scrambling* what homr said,
    and re-sorting by pitch would be a second, different claim -- that voice 1
    is the upper line -- which is false wherever two voices cross.

    Re-measured for issue #192 on the engine this host runs (`main @ 6c3bbf4`,
    issue #173's 63 bands re-read), sorting by pitch scores 67.7% and 84 voice
    faults against 68.2% and 67, and the only page it changes at all is Herää
    Suomi p3, where the two basses cross on the page and it swaps a column homr
    had numbered right -- 95.8% and 3 voice faults down to 85.6% and 20.
    **Those figures were scored by the comparator issue #196 has since replaced**
    -- it ranked a staff's voices by which was seen first, which one invented and
    never-scored moment can reverse (see :func:`assemble`) -- and they were not
    re-derived, so read the p3 swap as large rather than as exactly 10.2 points.
    What does not move with them is the reason for the refusal -- where two
    voices cross, "voice 1 is the upper line" is false of the page itself, so it
    is not a rule this function may adopt whatever the corpus digits settle at.
    Issue #196 reached that same conclusion from the harness's side, on its own
    settled figures: it refused mean height as a *comparator* rank because on
    `heraa-suomi-final-s10` the crossing basses leave the reference's own two
    voices 0.1 of a step apart, and shipped a bar count instead.

    Homr's numbering is also the better claim on the merits where the two
    disagree: over those 63 parses it puts the higher-sounding voice first in
    341 of the 357 bars carrying two, against 316 for the order the notes

    Columns are filled **from the top**: a system of two staves puts them in
    columns 1 and 2 and leaves the rest resting. That is not a claim about which
    voice is missing -- it is a refusal to make one. The per-system grid asks a
    person, per system and per staff, and top-alignment is the shape it expects.

    **So this file is a positional intermediate and reading it as the product
    gives a wrong number** (#195). On the four corpus pages whose systems print
    different staff counts it scores 28.3% against a per-system 93.5%; answered
    the way an operator answers it, the same pages score 77.2%, and what is left
    is two pages where a crop read one bar more than the page prints rather than
    anything about rows. Guessing the row instead would not close it: 7 of those
    pages' 9 narrow systems are divisi printed apart in one system and together in
    the rest, so the narrow system's first staff carries two of the page's rows
    and there is no single row to put it on. Both percentages were scored by the
    comparator issue #196 has since replaced and were not re-scored, **and so was
    the gap between them**. One comparator reading two files is a fair comparison
    under that comparator and not a guarantee that a different ranking would move
    the two sides by the same amount, so the gap is a historical measurement that
    nobody has checked against issue #196's rule.

    Three seams are closed here, all of them consequences of each crop being its
    own document. ``divisions`` is unified across the score and every duration
    scaled to it; bars are numbered continuously rather than restarting at 1 in
    every system; and a key or time signature is written only where it says
    something that was not already true. A ``<print new-system="yes"/>`` marks
    each seam, so ``clean_score``'s per-system mode cuts the score where the page
    is cut.

    The **meter is written here rather than taken from the crop** -- see
    :func:`_meter_plan`. homr cannot read a numerator (it has no token for one)
    and infers it from how long its decoded bars came out, one crop at a time;
    this is where both the bars either side of a seam and every staff at once are
    visible, so it is the only place the inference can be corrected.

    **A column's voices are not renumbered again here, and that is issue #187's
    other half.** A staff's voices are settled once, when it is flattened
    (:func:`_voice_numbering`), so the flip this card was opened for -- the same
    singer changing voice from bar to bar and, across a join, from system to
    system -- is gone before assembly sees it. What assembly could still be
    asked to do is reconcile *homr's* numbering between two crops, and it is
    deliberately not asked to. Each crop is read on its own, so nothing ties one
    crop's "voice 1" to the next crop's. Sounding height is the only evidence
    available at that point, and it is not sufficient: on Herää Suomi p3 the two
    basses cross and change places on the page, so a rule ranking by height
    would swap a column homr had right. Under the issue #141 rule a crop really
    read with the voices the other way up is homr's to fix, since it is the
    parse disagreeing with the page rather than us disagreeing with the parse.

    **Herää Suomi p1 was cited here as an example of that and is not one.**
    Issues #192 and #194 recorded homr numbering that page's two upper voices
    one way round in systems 1 and 3 and the other way round in 2 and 4, at 30
    voice faults; issue #190 retracted it. Each of the four crops agrees with
    its own reference -- 0, 0, 1 and 0 voice faults, system 4 note-for-note
    perfect -- homr numbers voice 1 the higher line in all four, and the bars
    the page-level score faults are correct on both sides. The 30 belong to
    `fixturecheck.compare._voice_rank`, which ranks a staff's voices by which is
    seen first: the first moment of staff 1 there is one note homr wrote a
    quarter early into voice 2, in a moment the reference does not have and the
    comparison never scores, and that one moment reverses the ranking for the
    whole page. Issue #196 fixed it (`eerovil/homr#37`, merged 2026-09-06): the
    harness now ranks a staff's voices by which is the higher line in more of its
    bars, and on that rule p1 stands at 70.9% with 1 voice fault and the corpus
    totals are re-scored. What is real there is bar 1's early entry, which is a
    rhythm misread and the fork's.

    None of that weakens issue #187's refusal to sort this assembler by height;
    it sharpens it. The *harness* needs a whole-staff rule, because it has to line
    one file's voices up against another's and first-seen is not a property of the
    music -- and it refused mean height too, for the same crossing-voices reason.
    The assembler must not rank by height at all, for the p3 reason above.

    ``timeSignature/<denominator>``; the number of beats does not exist in what
    the model can emit and is inferred afterwards from how long the decoded bars
    came out (issue #174). So the denominator is a reading and the numerator is a
    guess -- and it is a guess made one crop at a time, with no sight of the bars
    before the crop began. A crop holding 2/4, 2/4, 4/4, 4/4 has no median that is
    right about any of it.

    Here both are visible: the bars either side of a seam, and every staff of a
    system at once. So the numerator is taken from **the length of the bars the
    signature governs**, keeping the denominator homr actually read, and a seam
    that measures the same as the meter already in force carries it rather than
    restating a fresh guess.

    Two things it deliberately will not do, because the point of the correction
    is a score that still says where it is wrong:

    * It needs :data:`_MIN_BARS` **bars** -- not staff copies of one bar -- and a
      strict majority among them before it overrules a declared numerator. A
      single voice short of a note cannot rewrite the meter around its own
      mistake: it stays a bar that contradicts the signature, which is what the
      health check reports. And a bar whose staves do not agree on how long it is
      is no observation at all, so a span made of such bars keeps what it was
      given.
    * A whole-measure rest is not a sample. homr writes one a whole note long
