"""Which of a song's videos YouTube has, and freeing the local copies (#371).

A song's practice videos are 4K and about 150 MB a voice, so a song can hold
2 GB, and once YouTube has them they are only a cache: recording again draws
them from the score. This module says, per video, whether it is on YouTube, and
deletes the local copies when every one of them is.

"On YouTube" has two halves, and freeing needs both:

- **the record**: an entry in `record.uploads` for the video's part, with a
  `video_id`. An upload made since this module records which file it sent and
  that file's size and mtime, so a video rendered again after the upload no
  longer counts as uploaded. Older entries say neither, and some do not even say
  their part, which is then read off the end of the title.
- **YouTube itself**, asked at the moment of freeing: the video still exists,
  has finished processing, and was published after the local file was written.
  The last check is what covers an old entry with no file stamp.

Nothing is freed unless every local video passes both. A raw screen recording,
and an older take of a part another file has replaced, are never touched.
