"""Every problem the Fix stage knows of, one row per bar and part, with its choices (#290).

The Fix panel used to say the same thing up to three times — a sentence from
`fixes.json`, a red-mark health row, and the bar again under "Unsure bars" — and only
the last offered anything to tap. This puts them together: a row is a bar of one part,
it says everything wrong there, and where there is something to choose between it
offers a/b/c beside the page crop.

Where each part comes from, and why:

- **Red marks are read live off the cleaned score** (`problem_marks.marks`), not off
  the `clean-marker` sentences, which are only rewritten at the next clean: a pick
  that takes a mark off would otherwise leave its sentence showing. A mark whose
  health row was dismissed stays dismissed.
- **Other health findings** come from the health record, with their Dismiss.
- **Sentences** in `fixes.json` other than the red marks' own copies: a bar MuseScore
  refused, a rest the scan moved, a sentence somebody typed. A sentence with no bar
  is a row of its own.
- **Choices** are homr's readings of an unsure bar as whole bars — lengths and pitches
  together, and the second reading of the bar when homr has one (`bar_readings.offers`,
  #295) — and for a slur cleaning took out because it ran from
  one singer into another, the slur back in either singer, both, or none — worked out
  here from where cleaning recorded the two halves (`cross_voice_slurs.removed_slurs`).
- **A repeat with no start** (#312): an end-repeat sign with no start-repeat sign since
  the previous end (or since bar 1) is asked about, because homr misses a start sign
  that opens a printed system and the practice track then repeats the wrong bars. The
  choices are the first bar of each printed system in between, and **a**, leaving it
  as it is — the right answer when the page prints no start sign, kept in
  `.song.json` (`repeats.kept`) so the question is asked once.
- **A repeat with no brackets** (#319): every end repeat with no volta over it asks
  whether a "1." bracket ends there, because homr does not read volta brackets and a
  repeat without them looks the same in the score. **a** is no brackets (kept in
  `.song.json`, `voltas.kept`); the others put "1." over the last 1-4 bars, and "2."
  over the bar after.

Nothing here decides anything about the music: the rows are what is already known,
put side by side.
