"""Health check — surface OCR damage in the cleaned score as a punch list.

Validation only; never mutates the score. Findings:
  - malformed-measure: a voice whose note/rest durations don't fill the bar
    (the auto-fixers couldn't repair it — likely lost notes or a bad tuplet).
  - extra-voices: a staff measure with more than one note-bearing voice
    (the split didn't fully separate the voices).
  - unprinted-meter: a bar every voice agrees on, at a length the engraving never
    prints. The engraving is the only authority on meter, and this is the one
    finding that does not compare the score against itself — every other check
    here can be satisfied by a wrong answer that is merely self-consistent. It
    exists because a repair pass once "fixed" a 4/4 bar by padding every voice to
    9/8 and passed everything. It stays out of music that has no meter to violate:
    scores carrying an oversized nominal instead of a signature.
  - meter-collapsed: the same finding, counted instead of listed, for a score
    whose bars mostly declare their own length. See below — this used to be
    silence, and silence was the bug.
  - marked-problem: a red `⚠` mark cleaning left on a bar it had to change (a slur
    joining two singers, a bar cut back to its time signature, a bar MuseScore
    rejected). A person deletes the mark once the bar is fixed; until then it is
    listed, so the score does not look finished while one is left (#238).

Missing notes that *do* fill the bar (a half-rest standing in for lost notes)
aren't tick-detectable; they surface as lyric syllable overflow at import time.
Missing slurs are undetectable and stay manual.

All durations are computed as exact whole-note Fractions so tuplets don't cause
rounding false-positives.

# A score where most bars declare their own length may not be in a fixed meter -- it
# may be mixed or free, with MuseScore carrying the length bar by bar. One score here
# (Venematka) has an override on 20 of its 25 bars and would otherwise be reported 66
# times for being what it is.
#
# It used to switch the meter rule off entirely, and that was a hole. "Carries a length
# override" is also what a badly parsed score looks like: `fix_overfull_measures` writes
# one on every bar whose content contradicts the running signature, so the check turned
# itself off exactly when the score was worst. Benchmark page B6 crossed the line by
# being MORE wrong -- it misread an opening 5/4 as 3/4, which needed an override on bars
# 1 and 2 of all four staves, and those eight overrides carried it from 50% to 56%. It
# reported 3 issues where the same score judged on the same rules as its per-system
# parse has 32. A score bought silence by being worse.
#
# So the share no longer decides WHETHER to judge, only HOW TO SAY IT: above the line
# the bars are counted into one `meter-collapsed` finding instead of listed one by one.
# The noise the escape exists to prevent is still prevented -- Venematka's 66 become a
# single line -- and the count is on the wire either way, so the two sides of the line
# are comparable rather than one of them being blank.
#
# 0.5 is left where it was. Across the 35 cleaned scores in `songs/` the override share
# is 0.19 or below for every score except Venematka at 0.76-0.80, so the line sits in an
# empty gap and nothing real is near it; B6 is, and that now costs presentation instead
# of silence.
