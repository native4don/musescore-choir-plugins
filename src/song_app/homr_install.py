"""Install or update homr from the app, by running ``scripts/install-homr.sh``.

The script stays the one install path; this only runs it where a person on a
phone can reach it (#249). So nothing here knows how homr is installed — it knows
when it is safe to run the script, how to show what it says, and whether the
fork's ``main`` has moved past the commit this host has.

Three rules, each for a reason:

- **It is a press, never automatic.** The day a parse changes has to be a day
  somebody chose, which is why the deploy never touches homr's venv. A button
  keeps that; a timer would not.
- **Not under a running job.** The script replaces files inside the venv a scan
  is running out of, so it is refused while any song is scanning, cleaning,
  rendering or uploading, and scans are refused while it runs. Every homr read
  (a scan, *Ask homr*) holds a :func:`begin_read` token for as long as it runs,
  and taking one and starting an install go through the same lock, so neither
  can slip into the gap between the other's check and its start. Both are files
  beside the songs under an ``flock``, not memory: during a restart the old
  server and the new one overlap, and each has to see the other's reads.
- **One at a time, under one heavy slot.** An install is minutes of download and
  unpacking; a lock file holding the server pid makes a page refresh unable to
  start a second, the same way the recording and scan locks do.

Progress is a log tail the browser fetches while the install runs. The song
WebSocket is per song and this belongs to the host.
