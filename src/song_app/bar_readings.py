"""Let a person pick between homr's readings of a bar it was unsure of (#269).

homr marks a bar it is probably wrong about (`--mark-doubt`), and for each voice of
that bar with more than one reading that fills it, writes its three likeliest
readings into the MusicXML it hands back (`identification/miscellaneous`, field
`homr-bar-readings`; homr's `homr/bar_readings.py`). Only note lengths differ
between them. On Legenda system 11 bar 25 the reading homr chose was the wrong one
of two that both add up, and no rule can tell which: a person with the page crop
beside the options can, in seconds. So the Fix panel offers them.

**Where an option lands is found by what the bar says, not by numbering.** homr's
part, staff and voice are the crop's, and cleaning splits voices into staves, drops
and renames parts, and in per-system mode re-routes every one of them. What
survives all of that is the bar number (the system's first bar plus the crop's own)
and the music: an option is offered on the cleaned staff whose bar holds the same
notes, at the same pitches, with the lengths homr wrote. A tenor marked an octave
down still matches, at the same shift for every note. A bar cleaning changed — a
rest shared out, a bar cut back to its signature — matches nothing and is not
offered, which is right: the options are about a bar that is no longer there.

**Since #295 the options are whole bars** (`whole_bars`): every reading of the lengths
paired with every pitch homr weighed for an unsure note, ranked together, with homr's
second reading of the bar — the crop read again at 80% — always **b**. Picking lengths
and then a pitch one after the other mixed the two up; a whole bar cannot.

**A pick is a recorded fix** (`score_fixes`, kind `bar`; `rhythm` before #295), applied to the cleaned
score where it stands, the way the slur recorder does it: a re-clean rebuilds the
score from the scan and would throw imported lyrics away, and changing lengths
leaves every syllable on its note. `run_clean` replays it like any other entry.
Each entry carries the content stamp of the fragment it was offered from, and **when
that system is read again and comes back different the pick is dropped** before the
next clean, so the bar asks again rather than writing an old answer over a new
reading. **A pick follows its notes, too** (#291): re-answering the per-system grid
moves a part to another staff, so on a rebuild a pick whose staff no longer holds
the bar it was made on goes to the staff that does, and one whose notes are nowhere
in the bar any more is dropped, with a line in the clean's log either way. "None of these" is kept in the song state against the same stamp: the
reading stays as homr wrote it, the red mark stays, and the bar is fixed in
MuseScore.
