"""
Per-system score assignment (opt-in) for badly-parsed scores.

Some OCR'd scores assign parts to physical staves inconsistently: the same staff
carries different parts in different systems (e.g. staff 1 is T1+T2 at the start,
T3 at measure 20, T1 at measure 26). The only reliable cut is the printed system,
i.e. each line break.

This module owns the whole assignment-to-score behavior: it discovers the printed
systems, describes each system's staves so a caller can ask a human what they hold,
carries answers forward between systems, rebuilds the score as one clean staff per
named part (pulling notes from whichever (staff, voice) was declared per system,
measure-rests where the part is absent), restores the printed line breaks, and
writes the lyric-routing metadata the lyric importer reads back.

Two adapters sit at the seam and both go through the same interface:

  * the CLI prompt (`per_system_prompt.prompt_for_answers`), used by clean_score;
  * the web assignment grid (`song_app.pipeline.system_grid` /
    `save_system_answers`), used by the song app.

Both produce the same `Answers` mapping ({system_index: {staff_id: "T1,T2"}}),
which is all this module needs to rebuild a score:

    result = clean_per_system(root, input_path="laulun_aika.mscx")   # recorded answers
    result = clean_per_system(root, input_path=p, answers_from=prompt_for_answers)

Answers are remembered per input file, so re-running a score needs no retyping and
the song app can clean headless after the grid is submitted.

    Per-system printed-staff -> output-staff(s) map for lyric placement.

    The JSON lyric format numbers printed staves top-to-bottom *within each system*,
    skipping any part that is omitted there. Output staves, by contrast, are a fixed
    T1<T2<...<B set. This bridges them per system:
      - parts that share a source staff (divisi: two voices on one staff) become ONE
        printed staff (voice 0 -> 'above', voice 1 -> 'below');
      - printed staves are ordered by musical rank (S<A<T<B, then number), NOT by the
        OCR's source-staff order, which can be shuffled;
      - omitted/undeclared parts simply don't appear (so they're "missing").

    Returns a list of {"start", "end", "map": {printed_no: [output_ids]}} with 1-based
    inclusive measure ranges. A system where a `S1b` is left out and sings `S1`'s notes
    (`_fallback_of`) also carries "follow": {S1's id: [S1b's id]}, so S1b takes S1's
    words whichever lane of the printed staff S1 is on. It is kept out of "map" because
    "map" is the printed grouping: S1b is not on that staff, and a third id beside a
    divisi pair would break its above/below split.

    Every entry also carries "source": {source staff id: [output ids, upper voice
    first]} — which parts the grid put on which staff of the scanned input, in page
    order rather than rank order — and, given `staves`, "staves": how many staves that
    system prints. "map" ranks the staves, which is what the lyric JSON numbers; the
    Fix panel needs the page position instead, to know which part homr read (#310).
