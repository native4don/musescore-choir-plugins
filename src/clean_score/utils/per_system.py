"""
Per-system score assignment (opt-in) for badly-parsed scores.

Some OCR'd scores assign parts to physical staves inconsistently: the same staff
carries different parts in different systems (e.g. staff 1 is T1+T2 at the start,
T3 at measure 20, T1 at measure 26). The only reliable cut is the printed system,
i.e. each line break.

This module owns the whole assignment-to-score behavior: it discovers the printed
systems, describes each system's staves so a caller can ask a human what they hold,
carries answers forward between systems, rebuilds the score as one clean staff per
named part (pulling notes from whichever (staff, voice) was declared per system,
measure-rests where the part is absent), restores the printed line breaks, and
writes the lyric-routing metadata the lyric importer reads back.

Two adapters sit at the seam and both go through the same interface:

  * the CLI prompt (`per_system_prompt.prompt_for_answers`), used by clean_score;
  * the web assignment grid (`song_app.pipeline.system_grid` /
    `save_system_answers`), used by the song app.

Both produce the same `Answers` mapping ({system_index: {staff_id: "T1,T2"}}),
which is all this module needs to rebuild a score:

    result = clean_per_system(root, input_path="laulun_aika.mscx")   # recorded answers
    result = clean_per_system(root, input_path=p, answers_from=prompt_for_answers)

Answers are remembered per input file, so re-running a score needs no retyping and
the song app can clean headless after the grid is submitted.
