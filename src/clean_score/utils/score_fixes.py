"""Apply score edits that a person or an AI authorised, from a recorded list.

Some OCR damage cannot be repaired automatically and should not be guessed at: a
dot the scanner invented, a melisma slur it dropped. The automatic passes decline
these on purpose — `overfull_measures` will not touch a note, and slurs are never
mirrored because they connect different pitches and cannot be pitch-checked.

What is left is a judgement about the printed page, and the answer belongs in the
song folder as data rather than in a one-off hand edit that the next rebuild
erases. Each entry carries a `why`, because six months later the diff will not say
why a note lost its dot.

    [{"kind": "undot", "staff": 3, "measure": 26, "index": 0, "why": "..."},
     {"kind": "slur",  "staff": 4, "measure": 32, "index": 0, "span": 1, "why": "..."},
     {"kind": "append", "staff": 2, "measure": 73,
      "from": ["eighth:50", "eighth:50", "eighth:50", "eighth:R"],
      "add":  ["quarter:R"],
      "why": "..."}]

`staff` and `measure` are 1-based and refer to the **cleaned** score, where each
staff carries one voice. `index` counts chords in that measure from 0 — chords only,
not the rests `from` lists (`bar_items` pairs each token with its index). Applying is
strict: an entry that does not match raises, because a silently skipped fix would
leave the score looking repaired when it is not.

`append` works on the end of a bar, which is where every edit the other two kinds
cannot express has landed so far: the trailing rest an engraver drew once for two
voices, or the notes a scan dropped and padded over (`"drop": 1` takes the padding
rest off first). `from` is what the bar reads **now**, and the fix refuses to apply
unless it still reads that way — so a pipeline change that alters the bar fails the
build instead of quietly writing an old answer over a new one.

Tokens are `duration[.]:pitch` (`eighth:50`, `quarter.:60` for a dotted quarter),
`duration[.]:R` for a rest, and `+` between the notes of a chord. `[tuplet` and
`tuplet]` mark a triplet bracket: they appear in `from` and cannot be written. A
whole-bar rest reads as `measure:R` and cannot be written either — it needs the bar's
own length, which a fix has no way to know, so write the rests out instead. The
note's **spelling** (MuseScore's tpc) is derived from the pitch and the key in force
on that staff — flats for the black keys in a flat key, sharps otherwise (#357) — and
is deliberately not part of the token: the first fixes to carry one by hand got three
of four wrong, which puts a note on the wrong line while it still sounds right.

A fifth kind, `rhythm`, gives every note and rest of a bar a new length and leaves
the notes themselves alone. It is how a person's pick among the readings homr weighed
for an unsure bar is recorded (#269), so its lengths are homr's own spelling, one per
note or rest in order: `note_4` a quarter, `note_12` a triplet eighth, `note_4.` a
dotted quarter. `from` is the bar as it reads now, as above. Triplet brackets are
written again around the new lengths, ties and slurs in or into the bar are moved to
the notes they joined, and `rhythm?` comes off the bar's red `⚠` mark: a person has
read the lengths against the page. Whatever else the mark says, and cleaning's own
marks on the bar, stay (#290).

    {"kind": "rhythm", "staff": 9, "measure": 25,
     "from": ["[tuplet", "eighth:43", "eighth:48", "eighth:50", "tuplet]", ...],
     "to": ["note_12", "note_12", "note_12", "note_6", "note_12", "note_4", ...],
     "why": "picked reading c against the page"}

Three more kinds are how a person's answer to a problem listed on the Fix stage is
recorded (#290). `pitch` gives one note of a chord another pitch, picked among the
pitches homr weighed for it; `from` is the bar as it reads now, `was` the MIDI pitch
the note has, and `to` / `tpc` what it gets — the spelling is homr's, read off the
page, rather than derived. Its red note goes, and so do the words `pitch?` and
`accidental?` on the bar's red mark; anything else the mark says stays. A `slur`
may reach into a later bar with `end_measure` and `end_index` instead of `span`,
because a slur the scan ran from one singer into another usually crosses a barline.
And `unmark` takes one red mark off a bar — the answer "the page prints no slur here"
— and is content if the mark is already gone, because what it records is that
nothing in that bar needs doing.

    {"kind": "pitch", "staff": 3, "measure": 12, "index": 1, "from": [...],
     "was": 62, "to": 63, "tpc": 11, "why": "picked homr's reading b ..."}
    {"kind": "slur", "staff": 5, "measure": 19, "index": 3,
     "end_measure": 20, "end_index": 0, "why": "..."}
    {"kind": "unmark", "staff": 5, "measure": 19, "text": "slur to A2 bar 20 removed; ..."}

`bar` (#295) puts a whole bar of one voice as a person picked it among homr's
readings of it: lengths and pitches together, so one pick never undoes another. `to`
is one entry per note or rest, its length in homr's spelling and its MIDI pitches
with their spelling (`tpcs`), read off the page by homr rather than derived. When
the new bar has the same notes and rests in the same places, the lengths are
rewritten as `rhythm` does and the pitches set, so ties, slurs and words stay where
they were — unless a note that changes pitch is tied, since the tie would then join
two different pitches. Otherwise the bar is written afresh, as the second reading
of the bar can be: ties and slurs reaching into it from outside are cut, as when
MuseScore refuses a bar (`rejected_bars`), and its words are put back on its notes
in order, the extra ones dropped. A gap cleaning left in the voice (`location`) is
taken out first and the bar is written afresh, so the new bar has to fill the bar's
own length (#344). Otherwise the new bar may last as long as the voice does now or
fill the bar's own length; the second is how a voice the scan made too long is put
right, since false triplets can leave it a length (7/6) no writable bar adds up to
(#350). A bar whose length changes is written afresh.

    {"kind": "bar", "staff": 3, "measure": 12, "from": [...],
     "to": [{"value": "note_4.", "pitches": [62], "tpcs": [16]},
            {"value": "note_8", "pitches": [64], "tpcs": [18]}], "why": "..."}

`repeat` (#312) opens a repeat at a bar: a start-repeat sign on every staff. It has
no `staff`, because a repeat sign is drawn across the whole system and MuseScore
keeps one only when every staff carries it. It is how a person answers "where does
the repeat ending at bar N go back to?" when the scan read the end sign and missed
the start — which homr does for a sign that opens a printed system. A bar that
already opens a repeat refuses it.

    {"kind": "repeat", "measure": 46, "why": "the page prints |: at bar 46"}

`volta` (#319) puts the "1." and "2." brackets over an end repeat: "1." over the
`bars` bars ending at `measure`, which must carry the end repeat, and "2." over the
`second` bars after it (default 1). Only the "1." length changes what is played --
the second pass skips those bars -- so `second` only changes the picture. MuseScore
keeps a volta on the top staff only, so that is where it goes. A bar already under a
bracket refuses it, and so does a "2." bracket longer than the bars left; one that
closes the score ends at the end of its last bar, as MuseScore writes it.

    {"kind": "volta", "measure": 13, "bars": 2, "why": "the page prints 1. over 12-13"}

`unvolta` and `unrepeat` (#378) take out what the scan invented: Suomalainen rukous
came back with a second "1." bracket and end repeat on a bar the page does not print
(copied from the organ's 1st ending), and MuseScore and the engraving then disagreed
about which bars play. `unvolta` takes every volta bracket that **starts** in bar
`measure` out, on every staff, both halves; `text` ("1." or "2") narrows it to the
brackets reading that. `unrepeat` takes the `which` ("end" or "start") repeat sign off
the bar on every staff. Each refuses when there is nothing to take, so a re-read that
no longer invents it fails the clean rather than quietly matching. Put a bracket back
the way the page prints it with `volta`, and take the emptied bar out with `delbar`.

    {"kind": "unvolta", "measure": 19, "text": "1", "why": "..."}
    {"kind": "unrepeat", "measure": 19, "which": "end", "why": "..."}

`barlen` (#378) gives a bar that **every staff rests through** another length: each
staff gets one bar rest of `to` (`"6/4"`), written as the scan writes a bar that
differs from its time signature (`len`, dropped when `to` is the meter in force). A
note anywhere in the bar refuses -- changing the length of music is `duration`'s and
`bar`'s job. The 2nd ending above is printed 6/4 then 4/4; the scan read 3/2 and
cleaning cut it to 4/4, which only a person reading the page can put back. `from` is
required, as for `delbar`.

    {"kind": "barlen", "measure": 19, "from": ["whole:R"], "to": "6/4", "why": "..."}

Three kinds came out of fixing a song from its page with an LLM (#340), where each
had to be faked and every fake damaged the score. `unslur` takes out the slur that
starts on chord `index`, both of its halves, wherever the end half sits. `tie` joins
the note `pitch` of chord `index` to the same pitch in the next chord, in this bar or
at the head of the next one, so playback holds the note. `duration` gives chord
`index` the length `to` (`quarter..` for a double-dotted quarter); when that makes the
voice fill the time signature in force, the bar takes that length again on every
staff, and a total that neither fills the bar nor the signature refuses. Then the
back-steps cleaning squeezed the other voices into the short bar with go as well,
where a voice's own notes fill the restored bar (#344). Each needs its `from`.

    {"kind": "unslur", "staff": 3, "measure": 1, "index": 2, "from": [...], "why": "..."}
    {"kind": "tie", "staff": 2, "measure": 10, "index": 2, "pitch": 60, "from": [...],
     "why": "..."}
    {"kind": "duration", "staff": 2, "measure": 10, "index": 0, "to": "quarter..",
     "from": [...], "why": "the page prints a double dot"}

`untie` (#342) is `tie` taken back: it takes out the tie that starts on note `pitch`
of chord `index`, both halves, wherever the end half sits, so playback sings the note
again. Strophic songs print **dashed** ties that belong to a later verse only, and the
scan reads them as real ties, so the verse that re-strikes the note loses a syllable.
It needs its `from` like the others.

    {"kind": "untie", "staff": 1, "measure": 6, "index": 1, "pitch": 65, "from": [...],
     "why": "dashed tie, verse 2 only"}

`delete` (#352) takes a mark the scan invented off chord `index`: `what` is one of
`fermata`, `articulation`, `arpeggio`, `breath`, `staff text`, `tempo` or
`rehearsal mark` (#366: Trinklied's B1 bar 25 had a printed sharp read as an
arpeggio), and every mark of that kind on the chord goes unless `subtype` narrows it (an
articulation's `articStaccatoAbove`, a breath mark's symbol, a text's words). Only
these: taking one out never needs anything else changed. A slur, a tie, a note, a red
mark or the words have a kind of their own and are refused naming it; a clef, key,
time signature or triplet bracket changes the bar itself and is refused too. A
fermata or tempo mark another staff still carries at that beat is said in the log,
since MuseScore times the beat by any staff's. It needs its `from`.

    {"kind": "delete", "what": "fermata", "staff": 1, "measure": 13, "index": 2,
     "from": [...], "why": "the page prints staccato dots here, not a fermata"}
    {"kind": "delete", "what": "articulation", "subtype": "articAccentAbove",
     "staff": 3, "measure": 7, "index": 0, "from": [...], "why": "..."}

`delbar` (#346) takes out a bar the scan invented, on every staff: an empty bar
homr read between a "1." and a "2." ending, say. `from` is what the bar reads now —
one list when every staff reads the same (`["measure:R"]`), or one list per staff —
and it is required, because replayed against a better reading it would delete a bar
the page prints. A volta, slur or tie reaching across the bar is shortened by one,
both halves, and a volta ending on the barline before it keeps its length; one
starting or ending inside it, any volta starting in it, a repeat sign, or a clef,
key or meter change in it refuses. Fixes apply **in file order**, so an entry before a `delbar`
counts bars as they were before the deletion and one after it counts them without
the deleted bar — which is how fixes recorded before anyone noticed the invented bar
keep matching, and how one recorded afterwards in the app matches too.

    {"kind": "delbar", "measure": 10, "from": ["measure:R"],
     "why": "the page prints 4 bars in system 3; the scan added an empty bar 10"}

`insbar` is the other way round: the scan lost a barline and squeezed two printed
bars into one. It puts an empty bar (a whole-bar rest in the meter in force) **after**
bar `measure` on every staff, for `bar` fixes later in the file to fill. `from` is
what bar `measure` reads now, as for `delbar`. A slur or volta across that barline
is lengthened by one, a volta ending on it keeps its length, and a tie across it
refuses. File order holds as for `delbar`: entries after it count the new bar.

    {"kind": "insbar", "measure": 2, "from": [[...], [...], ...],
     "why": "the scan lost the barline between printed bars 2 and 3"}

`dropnote` and `addnote` (#358) take one note off chord `index` or put one on, and
leave its length, its words and its other notes alone. A page often prints an
optional note in brackets — a low octave, a divisi — and the scan reads it as a real
chord note, so the practice track sings both; the default is to sing the main note
only. `dropnote` also takes out a tie on the note, both halves, and refuses a
chord's only note (that is a rest, a `bar` fix's job). `addnote` refuses a pitch the
chord has and adds no tie; its spelling comes from `tpc`, else from a note of the
same pitch class in the chord, else from the key in force. Each needs its `from`.

    {"kind": "dropnote", "staff": 4, "measure": 17, "index": 3, "pitch": 51,
     "from": [...], "why": "the page prints (Eb3) as optional; B2 sings Eb2"}
    {"kind": "addnote", "staff": 3, "measure": 25, "index": 0, "pitch": 52,
     "from": [...], "why": "the page prints E3 under the G#3"}

`timesig` (#353) takes a time signature the scan invented off bar `measure` on every
staff (`"to": null`), or writes another one in its place (`"to": "6/8"`). homr read a
3/4 into a song printed in 6/8 throughout; the notes fit both, so the automatic
`spurious_timesigs` pass cannot tell them apart and only the page can. `from` is the
signature the bar carries now, on every staff, and is required. The bar keeps its
length or the fix refuses: a signature that changes the length of the bars after it
would leave every one of them wrong, so only a change between meters of one length
(3/4 and 6/8, 2/2 and 4/4) is allowed, and a removal only where the meter already in
force is that length. Bar 1's opening signature is never touched.

    {"kind": "timesig", "measure": 22, "from": "3/4", "to": null,
     "why": "the page prints no meter change; 6/8 throughout"}

Most edits are none of those kinds, and the shapes that are missing are not
exotic — turning a bar-length rest into a whole-bar rest came up on one song in one
sitting. So a fix can also just be a **sentence**:

    {"kind": "text",
     "what": "B1 bar 40, last eighth: drop the D, keep the C. The page prints one
              head per bass voice and the basses cross here."}

Nothing here interprets it. `apply_fixes` leaves a `text` entry alone and
`free_text` hands the sentences back, so cleaning can say out loud that the score
is not fully repaired yet instead of either refusing to clean at all or skipping in
silence. Applying one is a person's job — or an agent asked to do it, which is how
the sentence came to be written in the first place. What the file guarantees is
that the judgement survives the next rebuild.

    same word that entry's `from` list would carry, so what is shown and what is
    recorded cannot drift apart; `at` is where that token stands in `from`, rests and
    brackets counted. `starts_slur` says a slur already begins there, which is the one
    thing a caller has to check before offering to add another, and `ends_slur` that
    one ends there. `pitches` names each note with its MIDI pitch — what a `tie` or
    `untie` entry calls `pitch` — and whether a tie already leaves it or reaches it,
    since a tie recorded twice is refused and one that was never there cannot be
    taken out (#357). `marks` lists what a `delete` entry could take off the chord
    (#352), and is left out when there is nothing.

    Raises `FixError` for a staff or measure that is not there, so a caller asking
    about a bar out of range gets the same answer as a fix recorded against one.
