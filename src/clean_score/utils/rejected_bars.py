"""Reset a bar MuseScore 3 would call corrupted, and say what was taken out.

MuseScore checks every score it opens (`Score::sanityCheck`, `libmscore/check.cpp`):
voice 1 of each staff must add up to exactly the bar, and no other voice may run past
it. A score that fails is "corrupted", and on Sangerhilsen the full app crashed on it
outright. Only the app runs the check — a command-line export does not — which is why
every render here went through and the first anyone heard of it was a person opening
the file.

The bars that fail are the ones a scan read badly enough that a voice runs longer than
the bar, typically a triplet with a note lost and the rest of the voice stepping
backwards to make room. There is no reading of the page in them to recover, so the
staff's bar is reset to a whole-bar rest and the notes it held are handed back, for
the caller to write down where a person will see them. Losing them quietly would be
worse than leaving the file broken; losing them loudly is what makes it openable.
